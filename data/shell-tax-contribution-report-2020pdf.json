Shell uses tax incentives offered by Malaysia. Some PSCs meet the criteria for the Investment Tax Allowance (ITA) incentive for qualifying capital expenditure incurred. In addition, the Marginal Field Tax Incentive (MFTI) provides accelerated capital allowances for expenditure incurred from 2010 to 2024 and reduces the effective tax rate from 38% to 25% for qualifying fields.

Most employment taxes are paid by employees but some are paid by companies. Governments also generate revenue through indirect taxes on products and services, often asconsumption taxespaid by consumers but in some cases also by businesses. These includenon-recoverable VAT, customs, excise and other duties. When a business collects indirect taxes on behalf of a government, it carries the cost of gathering the financial data, preparing reports and executing payments. This process helps governments collect taxes more efficiently because it is easier to collect VAT from businesses than from individual consumers. OECD data on the average split of member countries\u2019 tax revenues show that corporate income tax raises around 10% of total tax revenues. GOVERNMENTS COLLECT DIFFERENT TYPES OF TAXES percentage Source: OECD (2018), Revenue Statistics 2020, OECD Publishing, Paris.

Decommissioning is a cost incurred as part of the life cycle of the field and is tax deductible. For late-life assets, decommissioning costs can generate net tax losses that offset profits made and taxes paid in previous years. As a result, tax that has effectively been overpaid is refunded.

These comprise: Indirect taxes:These numbers represent gross indirect taxes such as value-added tax (VAT), goods and services tax (GST) and duties arising on the products we sell.Indirect taxeson our purchases of goods and services, which may be borne by Shell or be available to offset and reduce the taxes paid directly by Shell to governments, are not included. Employee taxes:These include employee income taxes, employee social security contributions and similar payments. They also include taxes collected in joint ventures where Shell is responsible for managing the payroll of the joint venture. Certain taxes borne and collected by Shell are excluded from this report.

            "text": "DEFINITIONS ADVANCE TAX AGREEMENTS These are formal or informal rulings and clearances which tax authorities provide when there are complex transactions, unclear regulations or substantial values involved. These agreements reduce uncertainty and should always be in line with the letter and spirit of the law. APPROPRIATE SUBSTANCE Appropriate substance means that there should be an adequate number of employees, with suitable qualifications to perform their jobs, and appropriate physical presence in the relevant jurisdiction. Many businesses will for good reason outsource some of their activities to third-party service providers but the core income-generating activities would not. ARM\u2019S LENGTH PRINCIPLE This valuation principle is commonly applied to commercial and financial transactions between related companies. It says that transactions should be valued as if they had been carried out between unrelated parties, each acting in their own best interests. ARTIFICIAL ARRANGEMENTS These are transactions or activities which are undertaken without a core commercial purpose. BASE EROSION A country\u2019s tax base, which is the amount the government can raise in taxes, may be eroded by some companies engaging in profit shifting. As a result of perceived abuses by some, the OECD launched the BEPS project to protect members against base erosion. BEPS The OECD project to tackle artificial base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS). The guidance and legislation introduced to support the BEPS project means that companies are taxed \u201cwhere their economic activities take place and value is created\u201d. BOE BOE stands for barrel of oil equivalent which is used by energy companies as a way of combining oil and gas and refined products into a single measure. BONUSES Payments for bonuses usually paid upon signing an agreement or a contract, or when a commercial discovery is declared, or production has commenced or production has reached a milestone. BRANCH A branch is an office or business presence in a location other than where the corporate entity is established. CAPITAL PROJECTS These are long-term, capital-intensive investment projects with a purpose to build upon, add to, or improve a capital asset. Capital projects are defined by their relatively large scale and cost, and require considerable planning and resources. CO-OPERATIVE COMPLIANCE This can vary between countries but at its essence means that taxpayers and tax authorities have open and proactive discussions on matters that may impact a taxpayer\u2019s tax return and seek to resolve any areas of interpretation.

            "text": "COMMERCIAL REASONS OR COMMERCIAL CONSIDERATIONS Commercial reasons or commercial considerations refer to activities undertaken with a view to making a profit. An entity\u2019s presence in a country should be the result of commercial activities and it should have the appropriate substance to perform those activities. The management and directorships of the operating company should be in the country of operation. CONSUMPTION TAXES A tax due on the purchase of goods and services. Typically, this is a percentage of the sales price of the item or service. It is an indirect tax as it is levied and administered by the retailers or service providers but it is borne or paid by the individual purchasing the item. The companies that charge the tax have to administer the collection and payment on behalf of the government. CORPORATE INCOME TAX This is a direct tax imposed on companies\u2019 profits. It is sometimes levied at a national level but can also be levied on a state or local basis. COUNTRY-BY-COUNTRY REPORTING Country-by-country reporting (CbCR) was introduced for all large multinational enterprises (MNEs) as part of the OECD BEPS project. The report should disclose aggregate data on income, profit, taxes paid and economic activity among tax jurisdictions in which the MNE operates. The report is filed with the main tax authority (typically the tax authority in the country in which the MNE has its head office) which can share it with tax authorities in other countries. COUNTRY Throughout this report, \u201ccountry\u201d is used as the primary descriptor for a geographical area because that is the word used by the OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project in their proposal for country-by-country reporting (CbCR). This is one of the four minimum reporting standards to which over 100 countries have committed, covering the tax residence jurisdictions of nearly all large multinational enterprises (MNEs). In this report \u201ccountry\u201d may also refer to locations, jurisdictions or territories which have their own tax regimes or discrete rules. CUSTOMS DUTY A tax imposed on goods as they either leave or enter a country. Customs duties are also in addition to other indirect taxes such as excise, VAT or GST. It is therefore possible to have goods which are subject to excise duty, customs duty and VAT. DIVIDEND After payment of costs and taxes, a company may choose to make a dividend payment to its shareholders as a return on their investment in the company. After payments of dividends, any remaining surplus is termed \u2018retained earnings\u2019 and is available for reinvestment into the business. DOUBLE TAXATION This arises where the same income is taxed twice by two or more different tax jurisdictions. EFFECTIVE TAX RATE (ETR) This is the ratio of tax compared with the profits in the financial statements. SeeHow businesses are taxedfor an illustration. EITI EITI stands for the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. This is a global standard for the good governance of resources like oil and gas. EITI requires disclosure of information such as publication of data showing how much money governments receive from resource extraction. EMPLOYMENT TAXES These are wage taxes and may include social security contributions.

            "text": "EXCISE DUTIES This is a tax on manufacturers and is due at the point of production rather than sale. Companies which manufacture products that are subject to excise duties are responsible for reporting and paying these taxes. Excise taxes are in addition to other forms of indirect tax, such as customs duties, VAT or GST, and typically form part of the cost of the product. FEES Fees and other sums paid as consideration for acquiring a licence for gaining access to an area where extractive activities are performed. Administrative government fees that are not specifically related to the extractive sector, or to access to extractive resources, are excluded. Also excluded are payments made in return for services provided by a government. FID Final investment decision FISCAL POLICY A government\u2019s approach to taxes and spending. The policy will vary depending on different electoral parties, governing systems and between countries. GST A goods and services tax (GST) is a value-added tax levied on most goods and services sold for domestic consumption. GST is paid by consumers, but it is remitted to the government by the businesses selling the goods and services. HOLDING COMPANY The principal purpose of this type of company is to hold and manage investments in other companies or joint ventures. Holding companies differ from operating companies, for example they will need less staff but they still have commercial value as a way to manage and administer all the different investments within a group. INDIRECT TAXES Taxes raised on goods and services rather than income and profits. Examples include VAT, sales tax, excise duties, stamp duty, services tax, registration duty and transaction tax. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY Intangible property that is the result of creativity. This can include patents, trademarks, and copyrights. INTERNATIONAL COMPLIANCE ASSURANCE PROGRAMME The International Compliance Assurance Programme (ICAP) is a voluntary programme for a multilateral co-operative risk assessment and assurance process. It is designed to be an efficient, effective and coordinated approach to provide multinational groups willing to engage actively, openly and in a fully transparent manner with increased tax certainty with respect to certain of their activities and transactions. LOW-TAX OR ZERO-TAX RATE JURISDICTION SeeTax Haven. MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISE OR CORPORATION A multinational enterprise (MNE) or multinational corporation is a company or group of companies with business establishments in two or more countries. NON-RECOVERABLE VAT A business can typically reclaim the VAT charged on its purchases against the VAT it charges others on sales that it makes. The government therefore should receive VAT from the end consumer and not at each stage of the supply chain. However, a business may have non-recoverable VAT costs, where offset is not available or permitted.

            "text": "OECD OECD stands for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development which is an intergovernmental economic organisation with 38 member countries, founded in 1961 to stimulate economic progress and world trade. PERMANENT ESTABLISHMENT This describes the activities that take place in a country that requires the filing of a tax return and possibly the payment of taxes in that country. This is another name for a taxable presence. PREPAYMENT Corporate income tax payment regimes differ. Many tax regimes require payments to be made in instalments. These may be due before the final tax liability is known or agreed. PRODUCTION ENTITLEMENTS This is the host government\u2019s share of production. It includes the government\u2019s share as a sovereign entity or through its participation as an equity or interest holder in projects within its home country. PRODUCTION-SHARING CONTRACTS OR CONCESSIONS A production-sharing contract (PSC) is a contractual arrangement between the holders of a resource, typically a country\u2019s government, and a resource extraction company concerning how much oil or gas each party would receive. The company bears the mineral and financial risk of the initiative. It explores, develops and, if successful, manages production. Costs are recovered through the sales of oil or gas and what is left over is split depending on the terms of the contract. PROFIT BEFORE TAX These are profits after the deduction of operating costs but before the deduction of tax. This number forms the basis on which we apply local tax laws and then pay corporate income tax. PROFIT SHIFTING This is the term used to describe artificial arrangements whereby companies move profits from one jurisdiction to another jurisdiction in order to minimise tax payments. REVENUE AGENCY SeeTax authority. REVENUE This represents the total income earned by a company. It includes income from customers or other group companies and income received as royalties and interest income. ROYALTIES Royalties are generally payment due for the use of an asset. Mineral royalties are payments to governments or other owners for the rights to extract oil and gas resources, typically at a set percentage of revenue less any deductions that may be taken. See Trademark royalties. SALES TAXES SeeConsumption taxes. STATUTORY TAX RATE This is the tax rate imposed by law in a country. TANGIBLE ASSETS A tangible asset is an asset that has a physical form, for example plant and equipment.

            "text": "TAX AUTHORITY Also known as a revenue agency. This is the body responsible for administering the tax laws of a particular country or regional or local authority. TAX BORNE Tax that represents a cost to Shell and impacts upon its financial results. This includes Tax Paid (seeIntroduction to country-by- country reporting) as well as non-corporate taxes, such as employer social security contributions. TAX CHARGE The aggregate of current tax and deferred tax included in the determination of profit or loss for the period in our Annual Report and Accounts. TAX COLLECTED Tax that Shell does not directly incur but instead collects from its customers and employees on behalf of governments. This includes indirect taxes such as VAT and GST, as well as employee income tax and social security contributions. TAX HAVEN There are different definitions of the term tax haven but typically this is considered to mean one country offering significantly lower tax rates or other tax features compared with the average rates or features offered by other countries. TAX INCENTIVES There is no common definition of a tax incentive. Shell defines tax incentives as fiscal measures designed by governments to stimulate investment and encourage growth, or a change of behaviour, by providing more favourable tax treatment to some activities or sectors. Incentives can include accelerated tax relief for capital expenditure on infrastructure, exemptions from certain taxes where government economic targets (for example employment targets) are met, or a favourable tax treatment of costs related to research and development activities for certain technologies. TAXABLE PRESENCE SeePermanent establishment. THE B TEAM The B Team is a not-for-profit initiative aimed at ensuring that business becomes a driving force for social, environmental and economic benefit. Shell is a founding member of The B Team Responsible Tax Working Group but is not a member of the overall B Team initiative. Through The B Team, Shell and other companies have been able to give a voice to the companies\u2019 views in the debate on fair taxation. The B Team Responsible Tax Principles, which Shell has helped to develop, reflect the views of leading companies and civil-society organisations on a responsible approach to tax. TRADE TARIFFS A tax on imports or exports between sovereign states. SeeCustoms duty. TRADEMARK ROYALTIES Payments for the right to use trademarks. Trademarks are a legally registered name, word, symbol or design which identifies the goods or services of a particular business or company. TRANSFER PRICING This refers to the setting of the price for goods and services sold between related entities within a group. Transfer pricing should be based on the arm\u2019s length principle. This means that profits are allocated to the countries where the relevant economic activity takes place and cannot be artificially taken somewhere else.

            "text": "VAT Value-added tax (VAT) is a specific type of turnover tax levied at each stage in the production and distribution process. Although VAT is ultimately levied on the consumer when they purchase goods or services, liability for VAT is on the supplier of goods or services. VAT normally utilises a system of tax credits to place the ultimate and real burden of the tax on the final consumer and to relieve the intermediaries of any final tax cost. SeeNon-recoverable VAT. WITHHOLDING TAXES A withholding tax is an income tax to be paid to the government by the payer of the income rather than by the recipient of the income. The tax is thus withheld or deducted from the income due to the recipient. Withholding taxes usually apply to royalties, interest or dividends.

In this report \u201cShell\u201d, \u201cShell Group\u201d and \u201cGroup\u201d are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Royal Dutch Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise, the words \u201cwe\u201d, \u201cus\u201d and \u201cour\u201d are also used to refer to Royal Dutch Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them.

Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as \u201cjoint ventures\u201d and \u201cjoint operations\u201d, respectively. Entities over which Shell has significant influence but neither control nor joint control are referred to as \u201cassociates\u201d.

Through engagement with thought leaders, other companies, investors and civil society, we stay informed of developments that may impact our business. We also regularly engage with policymakers to support the development of tax rules and regulations based on sound tax policy principles. In this way, we hope to contribute to the development of fair, effective and stable tax systems. We also provide constructive input to industry groups and international organisations, such as the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), the B Team Responsible Tax Working Group (B Team) and Business at OECD, an international business network. INTERNAL VOICE In September 2021, Alan McLean, Executive Vice President Taxation and Controller, addressed a European Parliamentary hearing on tax transparency: \u201cWe intend to continue to improve transparency and we hope others will do the same... At the same time, we believe it is important for transparency requirements to be aligned and consistent to ensure quality and comparability of data when informing the public debate, as well as ease of compliance for companies.\u201d COMPLIANCE Shell invests significant time and resources in building processes to support accurate and timely compliance with tax legislation. We are committed to complying with the tax legislation of the many countries where we operate and seek to establish constructive relationships with tax authorities. In 2020, Shell filed around 5,900 direct tax returns and around 36,700 indirect tax returns. We filed these on time in almost 100% of cases. We also processed more than 24,200 separate tax payments. A small number of returns may be submitted late. When this is the case, we carefully monitor the reasons, learn from them and pay any applicable late-filing fees. If we identify errors in our filings, we seek to address these with the relevant tax authorities. Around 630 trained staff prepare, file and process our tax returns and payments. They are based in our business service centres in Poland, India, Malaysia and the Philippines. We also rely on a global team of around 300 tax experts who advise the business according to the Shell Responsible Tax Principles and our tax control framework. Where appropriate, we run training sessions for non-tax staff who need to be aware of tax compliance requirements.

We seek to submit accurate tax accounting data and tax returns, in compliance with the letter and spirit of the applicable laws, wherever we have a taxable presence. Our tax control framework, policies and guidelines set out the standards, risk management, controls and assurance that establish boundaries for our tax activities. The framework helps us to identify tax risks and sets out practical guidance for our staff, including the procedures for considering tax risks. All ventures that we operate must conduct their activities in line with our business principles. The tax control framework is part of the Shell Control Framework, which applies to every Shell entity, including its employees and contract staff, and to Shell- operated ventures. We monitor the adequacy of our system of risk management and internal control throughout the year. External auditors regularly review our tax controls as part of the audit of our financial results. Tax authorities in several countries, including the UK and the Netherlands, have granted Shell entities Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) status for customs duties. AEO is an internationally recognised status which indicates that Shell operates secure supply chains and has a strong compliance framework when it comes to customs processes and controls. One of the benefits of having AEO status is reduced reliance on physical and document-based customs controls.

Employees, contract staff and third parties with whom Shell has a business relationship may raise ethical and compliance concerns, anonymously if preferred, through the Shell Global Helpline. In 2020, Shell\u2019s Audit Committee discussed with management new and potential tax legislation developments in various countries and how their potential impact on Shell is being managed. They also discussed updating the approach to tax to make it easier to read, while not changing how we approach tax matters in practice, as well as our proposed responses to the continued demand for greater transparency of tax information. DEALING WITH UNCERTAINTY Our aim is to take sustainable tax positions in support of our business investments, which may be of a long-term nature. When we apply tax legislation, we do so with the reasonable expectation that our interpretation will be upheld in court. Sometimes, the law or how to apply it is unclear to taxpayers. In these situations, we may seek to find clarity by talking to thetax authority as part of a co-operative compliance arrangement. A co-operative compliance arrangement means we engage with tax authorities, providing them with real-time information before filing a tax return. We have co-operative compliance arrangements with the tax authorities in Austria, Italy, the Netherlands, Singapore and the UK. We are exploring possibilities for establishing moreco-operative compliancerelationships in other countries. In 2020, we continued our discussions with senior tax officials in Kazakhstan about a pilot co-operative compliance scheme. When co-operative compliance arrangements are not available, we may seek to engage with a tax authority to share our understanding of the application of the law. In the case oftransfer pricing, where there is uncertainty about the appropriate price for a particular intragroup transaction, we may apply for an advance pricing agreement (APA). Under an APA, the taxpayer and tax authority agree the transfer price that will apply before a tax return is submitted. Sometimes, agreement on tax issues cannot be reached quickly with authorities and we seek to resolve any outstanding issues so that the tax return can be agreed. The countries in which we operate have differing degrees of political, legal and fiscal stability. This exposes us to a wide range of political developments that could result in changes to contractual terms, laws and regulations. We continually monitor geopolitical developments and societal issues relevant to our interests. Tax authorities in different countries can hold conflicting views about how the taxation of multinational enterprises should be interpreted or applied. When this lack of clarity occurs within a tax treaty or agreement between countries, we may use a mutual agreement procedure where the authorities aim to resolve the issue between themselves. If we are still unable to reach an agreement with an authority, we may have to test the legal principle of the tax law concerned through the judicial system. However, we take this approach only when other options have not provided a resolution. For example, in 2016, we challenged a value-added levy on oil extraction imposed by Brazil\u2019s State of Rio de Janeiro because we believed the obligations arising from the law were not legally sustainable. In March 2021, the Brazilian Supreme Court ruled that the levy was unconstitutional. COMPLIANCE WITH TRANSPARENCY INITIATIVES We constantly review our tax disclosures and engage externally to improve disclosure of data that are meaningful to our stakeholders. The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) has developed Sustainability Reporting Guidelines that strive to increase the transparency and accountability of companies\u2019 economic, environmental, and social performance. The GRI 207 standard, which came into effect on January 1, 2021, supports comprehensive disclosure of country-by-country corporate income tax payments. GRI 207 provides best practice reporting guidance and contains many measures that Shell had already adopted. Some elements, such as the country-by-country reporting requirement, concerned information that we published according to OECD guidelines. In ourSustainability Report, we report performance against the GRI standards, including on tax. Shell seeks to meet themandatoryelements of the GRI 207 requirements,except foraggregatedcountrydata for entities that are consolidated. We followOECDrules for these entities.

The core Stakeholder Capitalism Metrics are 21 disclosures which are mapped to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. One of the metrics is for companies to disclose their total tax borne as a core metric. INNOVATION FOR THE FUTURE We continue to improve the quality of our data through the use of technology, including analytical tools that aid testing, assessment and interpretation of data. Tax authorities are increasingly implementing or expanding digital tax platforms, enabling businesses to file real-time tax returns, and are requesting access to our accounting systems. More and more countries are introducing digital VAT regimes that allow for the direct transfer of data from company reporting tools to the tax authorities. In recent years, these regimes were introduced in Spain, Hungary, Poland, Norway, France, Portugal and Luxembourg. We are improving our data management to meet compliance and transparency requirements more efficiently. In 2020, we continued to enhance our \u201cone click tax returns\u201d tool in the USA, which analyses transactions subject to excise tax on a real-time basis for accuracy and completeness. Reviewing transactions as they occur supports Shell\u2019s ability to file real-time tax returns. We are also developing and deploying other software for our reporting of indirect taxes which standardises, reconciles and classifies the data to aid preparation of the tax return with the appropriate tax treatment. In 2020, we implemented the tool in the Netherlands, the UK and Germany forVATor excise duties with further deployment planned in 2021. In addition, we are looking at how Shell\u2019s future accounting systems will deliver the data we need to meet the requirements of tax authorities in real time. We have started implementing a new central finance software platform and a new accounting system. These will help us develop a simplified data model across Shell.

We kept energy supplies flowing and our refuelling stations helped to keep emergency and delivery services on the roads. The unprecedented macroeconomic impact of COVID-19 led to a deterioration in commodity prices during 2020, with significantly weaker demand for oil, gas and other resources. Many governments put in place measures, such as tax incentives, to support businesses and stimulate economies as the pandemic negatively affected companies\u2019 revenues and jobs. Shell has made use of these tax measures only where appropriate and when aligned with our Responsible Tax Principles. For example, it is common practice in many countries for tax authorities to issue preliminary corporate income tax assessments during the fiscal year, requiring companies to make prepayments. Where possible, we have worked with tax authorities to revise prepaymentestimates for 2020 to account for the economic downturn and the latest estimates of tax due. This cooperation enabled us to pay the right amount of taxes. We have also made use of measures in some countries which allow taxpayers to submit indirect tax returns on a quarterly instead of a monthly basis. This has reduced the workload for our staff and pressure on systems and processes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Shell\u2019s tax team continued to provide the business with the advice and support it needed. It also focused on timely submission of tax returns and tax payments to governments. Our priority remains to support our colleagues, our customers and the communities where we work. We estimate that Shell\u2019s total contribution during the pandemic, including donations of funds, fuel, food, equipment and services, amounted to $46 million[A].

            "text": "CASE STUDY NORWAY FISCAL RESPONSE TO LOW ENERGY PRICES In 2020, Norway introduced temporarytax incentivesfor the petroleum industry as a response to declining energy prices and economic uncertainty, both of which may have reduced planned oil and gas investment. The measures were designed to secure jobs in the oil and gas industry and related services sector. We made use of these government incentives in 2020. In Norway, Shell is subject to an upstream tax rate of 78%. This comprises the statutory corporate income tax of 22% and a special upstream tax rate of 56%. The temporary tax measures include allowing oil and gas companies to deduct the cost of investments made in 2020 and 2021 against the special upstream tax in the year the costs are incurred. Previously, deductions would have been taken over six years. In Norway, there is also an additional 20.8% deduction of investment costs (known as an uplift) taken over four years at the 56% special tax rate. The new measures now allow companies to immediately claim 24% deduction in the year the investment cost occurred for the years 2020 and 2021. The temporary measures will also be available for new projects that have delivered a development plan by the end of 2022 which has been approved by the Ministry of Oil and Energy by the end of 2023. Temporary measures for new projects may only be claimed until the end of the year of the planned start of production. In 2020, Norway introduced temporary tax incentives to secure jobs in the oil and gas industry.

            "text": "TAX INCENTIVES We continue to review our approach to tax incentives, because we believe that greater transparency promotes a better understanding of what tax incentives are designed to achieve. There is no common definition of a tax incentive. Shell defines tax incentives as fiscal measures designed by governments to stimulate investment and encourage growth, or a change of behaviour, by providing more favourable tax treatment to certain activities or sectors. In 2020, we decided to use this definition to assess whether a measure offered by a government is a tax incentive. We seek to ensure that tax incentives are transparent and consistent with statutory and regulatory frameworks before deciding whether to make use of them. We only make use of incentives where they are aligned with our business and operational objectives and where we have a qualifying business activity. When we accept tax incentives offered by governments to support investment, employment and economic development, we seek to implement them in the manner intended by the relevant statutory, regulatory or administrative framework. If there is uncertainty, we will seek to engage with the relevant authorities to agree implementation aligned with the intended policy objectives.

            "text": "Our Shell Tax Escalation Procedure (STEP) provides a mechanism to escalate uncertain tax positions to the Shell Tax Leadership Team. In particular, we will escalate a decision to accept tax incentives that are not specified in law or not generally available to other industry participants. If we accept any such incentives, we will encourage the relevant authorities to make details of these incentives publicly known. In addition, we will make data available for governments to assess the economic impact of incentives when requested to do so by the relevant authorities. Data requirements vary by country, but might include investments, earnings forecasts or jobs created. Where appropriate, we make use of incentives which are aligned with the goals of ourPowering Progress strategy. Launched in February 2021, this sets out our strategy across our three business pillars: Growth, Transition and Upstream. GROWTH PILLAR Our Growth pillar comprises our Marketing, and Renewables and Energy Solutions (RES), formerly known as New Energies, businesses. Examples of tax incentives available to our Growth pillar include research and development credits and excise and customs dutyrebates for biofuels. The tax rules in most countries were written before the development of renewable energy technologies. Redesigning tax rules to include incentives that encourage the supply of and demand for renewable energy will play an important part in advancing the energy transition. These measures could help make zero-carbon energy more affordable so that it can compete favourably with fossil fuels. For example, some governments offer incentives for investments that will help to reduce emissions in sectors that are hard to decarbonise, like shipping, aviation and road freight. Many of the technologies for renewable power generation are in their infancy and require considerable upfront investment in infrastructure. Incentives encourage this investment and may include tax credits for solar projects or allowing accelerated depreciation for offshore wind turbines. For more on how we advocate for sustainable fuels, see ourBiofuels case study. TRANSITION PILLAR Our Transition pillar comprises our Integrated Gas, and Chemicals and Products businesses. These labour- and capital-intensive businesses typically require long-term investment in equipment and facilities. Governments may offer incentives to attract investment in such businesses to boost local economies and create jobs.

            "text": "CASE STUDY STATE AND LOCAL TAX INCENTIVES FOR OUR PENNSYLVANIA PETROCHEMICALS COMPLEX In Pennsylvania, Shell makes use of two tax incentives designed to encourage companies to create jobs and to encourage capital investment in the state. In 2012, Pennsylvania introduced the Pennsylvania Resource Manufacturing (PRM) Tax Credit. This is offered to companies that purchase and process ethane and use it as a petrochemical feedstock to manufacture ethylene. This incentive can be applied if a company meets certain criteria, including capital investment of more than$1 billionand employment of at least 2,500 construction workers. The tax incentive is effective until 2042 to help the state re-establish heavy industry after years of decline. In 2017, Shell began the main construction phase of an ethylene cracker and polyethylene derivatives unit, the Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex, that will qualify for the PRM tax credit. During peak construction, the plant employed up to 8,000 construction workers. Once it is operational as planned in 2022, it is expected to employ 600 staff and contractors. Shell also benefits from Pennsylvania\u2019s Keystone Opportunity Zone (KOZ) tax incentives. KOZ tax incentives encourage investment in areas under economic distress by providing sales and use tax exemptions, income tax credits and property tax incentives to companies that make certain minimum investments. Shell has met the minimum investment of$1 billionand 400 full- time employees and contractors in the zone. Our Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex is scheduled to be operational in 2022.

Construction of the facility will create 7,500 direct jobs. Since 2014, the LNG Canada team has worked closely with local communities, First Nations and governments to better understand how the project could help achieve their economic, environmental and community aspirations. To attract this investment in a large-scale industrial project that would create employment and benefit local businesses, the district of Kitimat established a tax exemption programme for the LNG Canada project. The exemption provides cost certainty through flat amounts for property taxes during construction and the first five years of operations. It is effective from 2019 to 2028. LNG Canada will contribute fixed property taxes of C$1.6 millionin year one, C$3.2 millionin year two, C$4.8 millionin year three, C$6.5 millionin year four, and C$8 millionin year five. LNG Canada will then contribute C$9.7 millionannually for a period of five years once the plant commences operations, with an annual inflation increase for British Columbia. The development is currently in year three. The district of Kitimat in Canada designed a tax exemption programme to benefit the community.

            "text": "UPSTREAM PILLAR Oil and gas exploration and production projects are long term in nature, requiring significant upfront capital investment before cash is generated. Despite advances in technology, exploration risks remain high. Governments use different fiscal tools to offer a competitive upstream tax regime to investors to balance the investment risk and reward, which fluctuate over the main stages of an upstream project: exploration and development, production and decommissioning. Upstream tax regimes usually include favourable tax relief for capital expenditure, such as investment allowances, and the ability to claim the tax benefit of asset depreciation at an accelerated rate. At the end of a project\u2019s life, decommissioning costs may, in some cases, be offset against the profits of earlier years. However, upstream tax regimes often apply higher tax rates when oil and gas fields are producing. See theDecommissioning case study. In Norway, we made use of temporary tax incentives for the petroleum industry in 2020. These measures were a government response to declining energy prices and economic uncertainty, both of which may have impacted planned upstream investment.

            "text": "LOW-TAX JURISDICTIONS Low-tax jurisdictions, so-called tax havens, are typically considered to mean countries with significantly lower effective tax rates compared with the average rates offered by other countries. In some cases, the corporate income tax rate is zero. Governments have a sovereign right to determine tax matters in their countries and sometimes set low corporate income tax rates to attract investment from outside their borders. In recent years, international organisations, such as the OECD, and many countries have discussed whether a country\u2019s low-tax policy may have a negative impact on other countries. They have also debated various ways of addressing this. Most recently and steered by the G20, the OECD has been developing proposals for a coordinated two-pillar response. Shell supports such an internationally coordinated approach which avoids problems caused by unilateral actions that can lead to the fragmentation of tax rules. Pillar One aims to align taxes more closely with local market engagement so that a larger portion of profits is taxed in the jurisdiction where sales are made, even if a multinational does not have a physical presence in the jurisdiction of sale. Pillar Two introduces new rules to ensure a minimum level of effective taxation for all profits made by multinationals. Shell has a taxable presence in 99 countries and locations, with different tax regimes and varying corporate income tax rates. When we are present in low-tax jurisdictions, we are there for commercial reasons, such as crude oil trading and retail sites. These reasons can also include the presence of companies that hold investments or perform other services we need such as pensions, finance and insurance. In line with the Shell Responsible Tax Principles, we do not use these locations to avoid tax on activities that take place elsewhere. When we invest in a country, we consider factors which include access to local or regional markets, the stability of the political, regulatory and social environment, local infrastructure and workforce. We also consider the overall costs of operation and the attractiveness and stability of a country\u2019s fiscal regime. However, the investment must first meet our strategic, business or operational aims. REVIEWING ENTITIES IN LOW-TAX JURISDICTIONS We conducted a review in 2019 and 2020 of Shell-controlled and Shell-operated entities incorporated or present inlow-tax jurisdictionsagainst our Shell Responsible Tax Principles. The review considered the purpose of the entity and whether it should continue to be in that jurisdiction. We identified entities that are no longer active and can be liquidated as a matter of good corporate governance. We also identified entities that can be restructured and held or operated from another jurisdiction. In other cases, our review concluded that the entities could remain in low- or zero-tax jurisdictions because there was a commercial reason for being there. As part of the review, in 2020 we liquidated four legal entities in Bermuda and relocated another two Bermuda entities to the Netherlands. We also reviewed recently acquired entities, such as holding companies in Saint Lucia for upstream and LNG operations in the Caribbean. Following this review, we consolidated the operations and simplified the holding structures. As a result, we identified four Saint Lucian entities for liquidation and completed these liquidations in 2021. In 2020, we also piloted a new assurance control process to transform this review into an annual exercise undertaken by the countrytax manager in each low-tax jurisdiction. This will now form part of the tax control framework from 2021 onwards and will provide ongoing assurance that Group structures in low-tax jurisdictions continue to be there for commercial reasons. The new assurance control process will also identify potential liquidations and restructuring. For example, at the time of our 2020 review, Oman was on the European Union (EU) list of non-co-operative jurisdictions, which is sometimes referred to as the EUtax havenblacklist. Our review concluded that the Shell entities in that country have substantial operational activities, including exploration, production, trading and retail. We therefore considered our presence in Oman to be forcommercial reasonsand appropriate. In this report, we share more detail about low-tax jurisdictions in the country pages. Further information on entities and ownership is available in theAnnual Report and Accounts 2020.

            "text": "SUPPORTING EFFECTIVE TAX REGIMES We advocate fair, effective and stable tax systems because they reduce uncertainty for both governments and companies. Such tax systems help countries develop sustainable budgets and help companies manage their investments more effectively. We support a transparent and coordinated approach to improving the global tax system where countries work together, build consensus and agree on applicable legislation. Governments may seek input from different stakeholders through public consultation when they design tax policies. We believe it is important to hold an open dialogue on fiscal matters as new legislation should be effective, practical to administer and facilitate the collection of taxes. For example, we continue to support the implementation of government-led carbon-pricing systems, including carbon taxes, and recognise them as an essential tool for reducing emissions and tackling climate change. We believe that smart policies from governments, such as applying a cost to emissions through measures such as carbon-pricing mechanisms, supported by effective steps to reduce emissions, are among the best ways to reach solutions and drive progress. We regularly share knowledge and best practice through participation in industry and professional associations. These include the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), the B Team Responsible Tax Working Group (B Team) and Business at OECD. TRANSPARENCY The Shell General Business Principles define our core values, our responsibilities and the principles and behaviours by which we do business. In all cases of advocacy, employees are bound by the Shell General Business Principles and Code of Conduct. As part of these principles, everyone engaged in Shell\u2019s business, including tax advocacy activities, must comply with the anti- bribery and corruption laws of the countries where we operate as well as those that apply across borders. This has recently been made explicit in the Corporate Political Engagement Statement published in January 2021. Our employees and contractors, and people working in joint ventures we operate, are prohibited from offering, paying, seeking or accepting a personal payment, gift or favour in return for favourable treatment or to gain a business advantage. There is no place for bribery or corruption at Shell. Shell senior executives, including tax and government relations professionals, lead our tax advocacy activities.

            "text": "CASE STUDY SUPPORTING INCENTIVES FOR ADVANCED BIOFUELS Biofuels are a renewable energy source, made from organic matter or waste, which can significantly reduce CO 2 emissions from transport. Biofuels are blended with other fuels such as gasoline and diesel. They can help decarbonise the aviation, marine and heavy-duty road transport sectors. Governments can use instruments like tax incentives to encourage investment in the development and production of biofuels. Most biofuels are produced from agricultural crops, such as corn, sugar cane or vegetable oil. However, there is an opportunity to increase low-carbon biofuels production without increasing land use. With this purpose, we are focusing on using new technologies to produce advanced fuels from alternative feedstocks \u2013 such as forestry products and agricultural waste (otherwise known as cellulosic materials, meaning they come from the fibrous walls of a plant structure). Our Ra\u00edzen biofuels joint venture with Brazilian energy company Cosan (Shell economic interest 44% with 50% voting rights) began production of second-generation ethanol (E2G) in 2015. This plant produced around 24 million litres in the 12 months to March 2021. Government support is a key driver for the growth of advanced biofuels and we advocate a policy framework that encourages investment. We believe that any new biofuels policies should include: Financial support and targeted incentives for investment in the construction of advanced biofuels facilities. Price support for a limited amount of time. Support could include exemption from fuel excise duties typically applied to traditional fossil fuels. Different and preferential customs tax treatment in cross-border movements of advanced biofuels compared with traditional fossil fuels. Targeted incentives for manufacturers in hard-to-abate sectors (aviation, marine, heavy-duty road transport) to develop propulsion technologies that can use higher levels of biofuels than today. Our Ra\u00edzen biofuels joint venture produces advanced biofuels from sugar cane residues.

            "text": "INDIRECT TAX ADVOCACY Around the world there are increasingly frequent and often complex changes to laws governing indirect taxes, such as VAT, excise duties, and environmental taxes. Many of these developments are linked to the energy transition and to economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, the growing electric vehicle market requires governments to consider the most appropriate mechanisms to ensure the fair and sustainable taxation of the sale and use of electric vehicles. Within the EU, one key element of debate is how to consistently apply VAT to electric vehicle charging services across all 27 member states, while also enabling them to meet their pledge to reduce emissions by at least 55% by 2030, compared with 1990 levels. Shell has been an active participant in discussions with the European Commission to agree a harmonised approach to electric vehicle charging that is consistent with the treatment of electricity supply in other contexts. Similarly, both the VAT and excise duty treatment of aviation and marine fuels are under review by the EU. As with theVAT treatment of electric vehicle charging, Shell supports indirect tax policies that promote lower- and zero-carbon transport solutions as long as any tax treatment is consistently applied throughout the EU. Shell supports measures that combat criminal activity. As a global business, we contribute our experience and insight to discussions aimed at strengthening processes and controls. Together with other companies, we also call for a simplified and harmonised regulation process in support of fair and efficient indirect tax systems. Governments need to ensure the fair and sustainable taxation of the sale and use of electric vehicles.

In April 2020, we announced our target to be a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, in step with society. Business activities are supported by centralised services, such as finance, legal and human resources. For more details, see the chapterSupporting Services. This report follows Shell\u2019s organisation in 2020 of Upstream, Integrated Gas and New Energies [A], Downstream, and Projects & Technology. For more information on our updated strategy and business structure, please see Powering Progress. UPSTREAM We provide natural gas that powers homes. Upstream manages the exploration for and extraction of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids. It also markets and transports oil and gas, and operates infrastructure necessary to deliver them to market. We need to discover resources and negotiate their extraction with governments and other stakeholders before operations can begin. Despite significant advances in technology, exploration risks remain high. We do not always find the oil and gas that we are looking for and may have to write off early investment costs.

It may be several years before we realise any revenues as projects move through development and into production. Upstream projects often span decades. We are exposed to market risks, among others, over the lifetime of a project and this impacts the taxes we pay. Low oil or natural gas prices may sometimes mean that upstream activities incur losses even during a production phase. In 2020 global oil demand weakened significantly as a result of COVID-19. Global demand was almost9 millionbarrels/day below the level seen in 2019 (source: IEA).

            "text": "CASE STUDY TAX TREATMENT OF DECOMMISSIONING COSTS IN DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS Decommissioning is part of the normal life cycle of every oil and gas structure. Safe and responsible decommissioning is a priority for Shell when a facility reaches the end of its life. This includes restoring the surroundings of offshore platforms and facilities in line with relevant legislation, while taking our own environmental standards into account. The decommissioning phase of work is heavily regulated and subject to tax legislation that enables tax relief. The concept of granting tax relief for genuine business expenses is fundamental to regimes that tax profits and is applicable and available to all businesses in all industries with few exceptions. Decommissioning costs in the oil and gas industry are treated consistently as a business expense. At the end of 2020, Shell reported$27.3 billionon its balance sheet for non-current decommissioning and other provisions (see ourAnnual Report and Accounts). Corporate income tax is paid on profits, which for an oil or gas field are calculated as the sum of the income generated by the facility, minus the costs of setting it up, operating it and decommissioning the field at the end of its life. Decommissioning costs are treated differently depending on a country\u2019s tax regime. For example, in the UK costs can only be deducted once decommissioning starts, whereas in other countries these costs can be deducted annually before the asset is decommissioned. Here we present examples of how tax relief for decommissioning costs is obtained in two different countries: DECOMMISSIONING IN THE UK Our largest decommissioning project is theBrent oil and gas field, which lies in the North Sea between the UK and Norway. Preparation for decommissioning the four Brent platforms \u2013 Alpha, Bravo, Charlie and Delta \u2013 started in 2006. We decommissioned Brent Delta in 2017 and Brent Bravo in 2019. In 2020, the Brent Alpha topside, the part of the platform that is visible above the sea, and the upper jacket, which supports the topside, were removed and sent for dismantling and recycling onshore. The UK tax regime prescribes that a deduction for decommissioning costs is available only when the cash associated with decommissioning costs has actually been spent. If large sums of cash are spent on decommissioning in a year when insufficient income is generated by the business, this can result in a tax loss for that year. When this occurs, that loss is used to offset historical tax that has been paid in prior years and this results in a tax refund. The taxable profits over the field\u2019s lifetime will be the same as if the decommissioning deductions had been taken earlier, before decommissioning. The refunds do not represent any additional subsidy or contribution towards this cost. The UK government has received more than\u00a320 billion [A]in tax revenues (in today\u2019s money) from the Brent oil and gas field since it started producing in 1976. In 2020, Shell received a\u00a367.5 million[B] refund in respect of its Brent decommissioning activities. Decommissioning is due to be completed in 2024. Once complete, the total tax refunds Shell will have received are expected to be significantly less than the tax payments made. [A] This is the equivalent of $25.7 billion calculated using yearly average exchange rate for USD/GBP in 2020 of 1 USD = 0.7795 GBP. [B] This is the equivalent of $86.6 million calculated using yearly average exchange rate for USD/GBP in 2020 of 1 USD = 0.7795 GBP.

DECOMMISSIONING IN KAZAKHSTAN Kazakhstan requires companies operating under active concession or production-sharing agreements that have been signed since 1997 to set up a decommissioning fund. Each individual contract specifies when the fund should be established. Companies are required to make regular contributions to the fund to cover any future decommissioning costs. Contribution amounts are specified in the concession contract or production-sharing agreement. This system allows for companies to spread decommissioning costs over the lifetime of a project. Once companies have paid these contributions into an escrow account, they can tax-deduct them rather than wait years for the actual decommissioning costs to be deductible at the end of a project\u2019s lifetime. If actual decommissioning costs exceed what is available in the fund, then the rules allow for excess costs to be tax deductible in the year the cash is spent. If the fund accumulates more cash than is spent on decommissioning, then the excess cash is subject to corporate income tax as income at the end of the life of the field. Shell\u2019s existing production-sharing agreements in Kazakhstan have similar provisions to the decommissioning fund.

It includes natural gas exploration and extraction, and the operation of upstream and midstream infrastructure necessary to deliver gas to market. It markets and trades natural gas, LNG, electricity and carbon-emission rights and also markets and sells LNG as a fuel for heavy-duty vehicles and marine vessels. In New Energies, which was rebranded to Renewables and Energy Solutions in 2021, we are exploring emerging opportunities and investing in those where we believe sufficient commercial value is available. We focus on new fuels for transport, such as advanced biofuels, hydrogen and charging for battery-electric vehicles; and power, including from natural gas and low-carbon sources such as wind and solar. Natural gas prices, production volumes and operating expenses impact earnings and tax contributions. Global gas demand is estimated to have declined by around 2.4% in 2020, in contrast with the 2.5% annual growth rate observed since the start of the century. The deterioration in gas demand for power generation and in industry was mainly caused by lockdowns related to COVID-19. Average gas prices were lower in 2020 compared with 2019.

            "text": "CASE STUDY TAXATION OF LNG WITH OFFSETS We are working with our customers to reduce the emissions created when they use our energy products. New types of products and supply chains will be established to meet the growing demand for low-emission products. We expect this to change the amount and types of taxes we pay in some countries. For example, we provide liquefied natural gas (LNG) with offsets [A] which uses nature-based carbon credits to offset the full life-cycle emissions associated with the production and use of LNG. Credits are sourced from Shell\u2019s global portfolio of nature- based carbon offset projects. Our cargoes of LNG with offsets span many tax jurisdictions, from the countries where we source our LNG and carbon offsets to the countries where our customers are located. The taxation of LNG with offsets is complex because of the different tax rules in different locations. The revenue from the sale of a cargo of LNG with offsets is assessed for tax when the title passes to the customer. Direct and indirect taxation may vary in some jurisdictions, depending on whether the LNG and the carbon credits are bundled or sold separately. There may be differences in the indirect tax treatment of LNG and carbon credits, depending on the jurisdiction of the seller. In addition, there may be different customs and indirect tax treatments in the customer\u2019s import jurisdiction. Credits used for LNG with offsets are sourced from Shell\u2019s global portfolio of nature-based carbon offset projects. [A] The terms \u201ccarbon offset\u201d or \u201ccarbon offset compensation\u201d indicate that Shell has engaged in a transaction to ensure that an amount of carbon dioxide equivalent to that associated with the production, delivery and usage of the fuel has been removed from the atmosphere through a nature-based process or emissions saved through avoided deforestation.

            "text": "TAXATION OF OUR BUSINESSES Our tax data reflect the varied nature of our activities. We have a large portfolio of assets and businesses in different countries and at different stages of the business cycle, from start-up to decommissioning. The business model, the stage in the investment cycle and business performance drive much of our taxes paid. Our business profits are closely linked to oil and gas prices and so are our taxes. When oil prices are higher, we see a greater proportion of profits being taxed at higher upstream tax rates. When oil prices are lower, a lower overall effective tax rate (ETR) might be expected. While average oil and gas industry prices in 2020 were lower than in 2019, Shell\u2019s ETR in 2020 was primarily influenced by asset impairments. Further details on our ETR can be found in theAnnual Report and Accounts 2020. The Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses generate a significant part of our taxation charge. Governments often have specific oil and gas fiscal regimes with tax rates that are higher than those for other industries. Upstream and Integrated Gas projects have phases and our total tax fluctuates depending on the phase of a project. Our contributions to a country are not always included in the corporate income taxes reported. We may have agreed with governments to make payments as a share of the oil and gas we produce, throughroyaltiesor indirect taxes. Details of these payments are included in ourPayments to Governments Report. Downstream includes the business activities for manufacturing and energy production, chemicals, transport and trading, and sales and marketing. These activities are usually taxed at a country\u2019s standard rate of corporate income tax. Downstream tax contributions are mainly driven by our physical presence in countries where we have refineries, chemical plants and retail sites. In addition to corporate income taxes, we pay import and export duties and other tariffs on our transport and trading activities. Our Retail business handles large volumes of sales transactions, which incur consumption taxes and fuel duties. These are collected and paid to the authorities. Manufacturing and energy production require a significant number of employees working in plants and refineries, raising revenues for governments through employment taxes. Companies in Projects & Technology pay taxes in the countries where they reside. The service fees they charge are typically tax deductible for the recipient as business costs, following local tax principles and rules. Corporate covers the non-operating activities and central functions that support our businesses. The majority of the costs related to our headquarters and central functions are recovered from the business segments. Those costs that are not recovered are retained in Corporate.

            "text": "ALLOCATION OF COSTS Shell\u2019s centralised services and business service centres charge fees for services that provide a benefit for the receiving entities and which these entities would have been willing to pay a third party to provide. Shell\u2019s operating companies using centralised services pay a fee, which is based on the actual cost of providing the services. The costs of these services are incurred in direct support of Group business activities and need to be fairly charged to the entities benefiting from the services. All Group entities should bear their fair share of the costs. Costs are not excessively charged to entities in higher-tax jurisdictions where they could be deducted and used to manipulate taxable profit to a lower level. In cases where there is just one recipient of a service, the entity pays a direct fee for the service it has received based on the actual cost of the service. However, if there are different entities receiving the same service, they share the cost. Their share is allocated proportionately based on an appropriate measure of the usage of the service, for example capital and operating expenditure, staff employed or orders processed. Shell\u2019s service cost allocation system, including the proportionate allocation of costs, is set up and operated in accordance with the guidance provided by the OECD. BUSINESS SERVICE CENTRES Our businesses are supported by business service centres around the world. The choice of location for these centres is based on available expertise and costs which compare favourably with alternative outsourcing solutions. The centres provide significant employment opportunities with 18,000 staff worldwide. Some of their activities benefit from local tax exemptions where, for example, certain employment levels are met. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY Information technology (IT) provides capabilities that improve the way we do business. IT services are centralised in India and Malaysia.

Treasury also advises on the financing of Group subsidiaries and joint ventures and manages the Group\u2019s surplus funds and external bank accounts. It is also responsible for issuing external and internal guarantees to ensure contractual and regulatory obligations are met and that Shell\u2019s licence to operate is maintained. Oil, gas and renewables projects, which can take years to develop, need significant capital. Our operating companies require a balance between equity and long-term loan funding. We have capitalised Group lending entities in the Netherlands, the UK and Singapore to provide the loan financing. We ended our Swiss and Bermudan lending activities in 2019 and mid-2020 respectively, after reviewing their presence in theselow-tax jurisdictions. Treasury reviews the funding needs of Shell\u2019s operating companies around the world on a case-by-case basis to ensure there is an appropriate mix of equity and debt. Treasury manages deposits from operating companies that generate cash. This cash, the returns from operating companies plus external debt, is used to provide long-term funding including loans with interest due and paid as if these loans had been sourced from external financial markets or institutions. Related party lending, borrowing, guarantee offers and acceptance, and governance processes are decided by the boards of the Shell lending and borrowing companies respectively, independently and on a standalone basis. INSURANCE The oil and gas industry can face severe, low-frequency risks. Globally, there are few insurers who can insure appropriately against some of these risks. Shell \u2013 like other major oil and gas companies \u2013 self-insures most of its risk exposure. Shell\u2019s principal insurance company, Solen Versicherungen AG (Solen), is based in Switzerland where we have qualified insurance specialists to manage our insurance activities. This includes underwriting, risk management, claims handling and balance sheet management. Solen does not outsource any of its critical business functions. Solen offers a range of insurance products and services to Shell operating companies and joint venture companies, including those that are not controlled by Shell. It offers terms and conditions that would be available from external insurance companies operating in the energy sector. Solen has a licence to conduct insurance business from the Swiss insurance regulator (the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, FINMA). FINMA\u2019s regulatory requirements for Solen are the same as for independent insurance companies. Solen maintains the required level of capitalisation to comply with Swiss regulatory and rating agency requirements. Solen\u2019s capital is maintained at a level that ensures an \u2018A\u2019 rating from global credit rating agency AM Best. This is higher than the Swiss solvency requirements and allows Solen to enter into commercial arrangements with third-party insurance suppliers and joint- venture customers. Solen uses robust methodologies and governance processes to assess, mitigate and manage the risk of its insurance, re- insurance and associated investment functions that provide a commercial benefit to Shell-controlled and some non-Shell- controlled operating companies. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY Shell companies have access to specialist expertise in long-term brand building, consistent brand strategy and global marketing campaigns.

We have set ambitious targets against each of these goals as we work to play a leading role in the energy transition while making a positive contribution to society. In November, we took a further step to simplify Royal Dutch Shell plc and strengthen our competitiveness. We announced plans to establish a single line of shares, and to align the tax residence of Royal Dutch Shell plc with itscountryof incorporation in the UK. This proposal, which has been approved by our shareholders, will allow us to manage our portfolio with greater agility and to accelerate distributions to shareholders, among other benefits. We believe these changes will support the delivery of our strategy, including our focus on being a responsible provider of energy products, while demonstrating our values and principles. These values and principles are reflected in our commitment to safety, to respecting human rights and to paying the right amount of taxes so that we make a meaningful financial contribution to the countries where we operate. As countries seek to rebuild economies affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, the payment of taxes by companies is more important than ever. We support the co-ordinated effort to make the global tax system fairer and the agreement to establish a global minimum corporate tax reached by the G20 leaders, together with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. TRANSPARENCY IN CHALLENGING TIMES One of the ways we can show we are responsible contributors to society is to be transparent about what we do. That is why we are publishing our third Tax Contribution Report, which details thecorporate income taxwe have paid in 99 countries. Each year, we look to expand and improve our report and I hope you find value in these changes. This report covers 2020, a year when the COVID-19 pandemic had a devasting effect on people\u2019s health and finances, triggering an economic downturn. The oil industry faced falling demand and the first negative oil price in history.

            "text": "INTRODUCTION TO COUNTRY-BY-COUNTRY REPORTING In this report, we disclose ourcountry-by-country report(CbCR) data for 99 countries and locations in which we have ataxable presenceand where we report financial figures. Where CbCR report data are not available for this report, we have provided information from our Payments to Governments Report [A]. Our Payments to Governments Report also discloses other forms of payments. These include production entitlements, royalties, fees and bonus payments. Where made, these payments have been referenced under each applicable country. We share more information about our presence and purpose in each country and location, as well as relevant financial data which help determine Shell\u2019s overall tax and economic contribution. The OECD developed and implemented CbCR in 2017 and all large multinational enterprises are required to file reports with tax authorities. The nature of our business varies and we can have more than one kind of activity wherever we are present. Under OECD rules, CbCR is prepared using aggregated financial data. It is therefore not always possible to draw conclusions about a single entity, business or venture. This report shows aggregated country data for entities that are consolidated or proportionally consolidated in the Annual Report and Accounts 2020. We also include data for the Shell share of non-consolidated joint ventures and associates. These data are reported in the country where the entity holding the shares is based. Shell uses International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) data and US dollars as the reporting currency in its CbCR. The main data source is the consolidated Group reporting system, but reliance is also placed on data from local accounting systems for specific items. The financial information taken from our consolidated Group reporting system has been prepared under Shell\u2019s general financial controls. CbCR reports are not subject to an external audit, statement or opinion. CBCR DEFINITIONS The OECD requires certain data to be included in CbCR. See below for definitions of the key country-by-country reporting terms. REVENUES Revenues are disclosed as a split between those from related parties and those from third parties. For CbCR, third parties would include non-consolidated joint ventures and associates for the purposes of our Annual Report and Accounts 2020. Third-party revenues include sales of products, interest income,dividendincome and other income. Related-party revenues include transactions between consolidated Group entities. For example, related-party revenues arise if our Trading organisation buys oil or gas from our Upstream organisation and sells it to our Downstream organisation. Within one country or location, many of these related party transactions may occur, as Shell entities buy and sell goods, or provide and receive services, to or from each other. Shell includes all these transactions in its aggregated CbCR data. For example, feedstock could be sold to a refinery, refined and then processed further in a chemical plant before being traded by Shell. This can occur within one country or location. In this case, each of these sales between different entities would be counted as related-party revenues. These can represent large amounts. PROFIT BEFORE TAX Profit or loss before tax is reported in Shell\u2019s Consolidated Statement of Income. Any share of profit or loss from non-consolidated joint ventures and associates is reported under the country where the entity holding the shares is based. This is the profit or loss calculated using Group accounting policies. Local statutory accounts may need to comply with local accounting standards which may be different. The local statutory accounting profit or loss is the basis for the calculation of taxable profits in individual countries or locations. Local tax laws are then applied to the profit or loss. Profit before tax shows the Group accounting result but not the profits subject to tax after compliance with local tax laws. [A]Payments to Governments Report for 2020.

In some cases, this may include payments made in relation to previous years or future years as tax payments are often made in arrears or in advance. It also includes accruedwithholding taxeson dividend, interest and royalty payments to Shell entities. It does not include withholding taxes collected by Shell on dividends paid to shareholders. TAX ACCRUED This is the amount of corporate income tax for 2020 recorded as current-year tax in Shell\u2019s Consolidated Statement of Income. This also includes withholding tax accrued. It does not include prior-year adjustments, deferred tax or provisions for uncertain tax liabilities. STATED CAPITAL This information is sourced from local statutory accounts and is the amount of money invested in return for shares. The OECD rules require aggregated data, including for stated capital. This means that when a holding company invests in a subsidiary, which then invests in another subsidiary, all within the same country, each of those investments is counted and aggregated. ACCUMULATED EARNINGS Accumulated earnings reflect the profits retained and not used for any other purpose, such as to pay dividends to shareholders. NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES This is the average number of employees in the year, including permanent and temporary staff on long-term contracts. Some of our businesses are labour-intensive. Others, such as holding companies which hold shares in subsidiaries or joint ventures, are not. TANGIBLE ASSETS The data reported in line with CbCR comprise property, plant and equipment and inventories as at the closing balance sheet date on December 31, 2020.

Shell expanded its offshore activities in Egypt when it acquired BG Group in 2016. In 2020, Shell was the contractor for 22 ring-fencedproduction-sharing contracts(PSCs), which cover 14 areas in the Western Desert and eight offshore. Offshore contracts comprise seven PSCs in the Mediterranean Sea (including one non-operated) and one PSC in the Red Sea. In October 2019, we announced our intention to sell our onshore upstream assets in Egypt and in 2020 the divestment was still in progress. Shell\u2019s downstream activities in Egypt include the blending and marketing of lubricants. COUNTRY FINANCIAL ANALYSIS Egypt\u2019s statutory corporate income tax rate was 22.5% in 2020 and the corporate income tax rate for the exploration and production of hydrocarbons was 40.55%. The taxable income of each concession and legal entity is determined separately under Egyptian law. Consequently, the Egyptian tax base differs from the consolidated profit before tax reported under IFRS. The tax paid figure relates to Shell\u2019s downstream and onshore upstream activities. Corporate income tax was paid for onshore activities but not for offshore activities because of losses incurred in previous years in the offshore concessions. These were carried forward and offset against profits arising in 2020, resulting in no taxable base for offshore activities. OurPayments to Governments Report for 2020shows that Shell paid around $15 million in bonuses and fees.

All On Partnerships for Energy Access Limited (All On), wholly owned by SPDC and SNEPCo, was set up in 2016 as a company limited by guarantee for the purpose of closing the access to energy gap in Nigeria with a special focus on the Niger Delta area. In collaboration with its partners, All On is increasing access to commercial energy products and services for off-grid communities in under-served and unserved areas of Nigeria.

Shell companies still paid $3.4 billion in corporate income tax as some of our companies made a profit in 2020 and/or settled taxes from the previous year. Shell paid a further $3.5 billion in royaltiesto governments. We collected $40.4 billion in excise duties,sales taxesand similar levies on our fuel and other products on behalf of governments. And we made other payments to governments including $7 billion in production entitlements, $1.2 billion in fees and $16 million inbonuses. EXPANDING OUR REPORTS Shell continues to be open about the taxes we pay while looking to provide more insight into the role of tax in our businesses. For example, for this report, we have reviewed our reporting oftax incentives, including exemptions and reliefs. Governments around the world use tax incentives to encourage investment, job creation and to support certain industries. They also use them to drive key policies, such as reducing carbon emissions and protecting the environment. We believe that more transparency around these incentives will lead to greater understanding of what they are intended to achieve and whether they are meeting their goals. We have expanded our reporting of tax incentives as a result, with many examples in this report. We have also continued to review our presence in low- and zero-tax jurisdictions, countries with significantly lower tax rates than the average, against our Responsible Tax Principles. This resulted in our ending some activities in Bermuda and St Lucia. And we will keep assessing whether our presence inlow-tax jurisdictionsis appropriate for our business. WIDER CONTRIBUTION This report includes a breakdown of our total tax contribution in five countries where we have key business activities: the UK, the USA, the Netherlands, Nigeria and India. This goes beyond corporate income tax to include the taxes we pay as an employer, such as social security payments, and the taxes we collect from our employees on behalf of governments. We hope this more detailed look at these five countries provides a clearer picture of our activities and contribution to the countries where we operate. We will extend this approach to other countries if we hear from investors, governments, non- governmental organisations and wider society that it would help them to further understand our contribution. Thank you for your interest in understanding Shell and our approach to tax. We welcome your feedback as we look to provide meaningful and insightful information on the taxes we pay.

Shell also has exploration activities in two offshore blocks in the Cuenca Argentina Norte basin (South Atlantic) with Qatar Petroleum. In 2018, Shell sold its Argentinian downstream business to the Ra\u00edzen Group, which is a joint venture between Shell and the Brazilian company Cosan. The Shell brand continues to be present in the country through a brand licence agreement with Ra\u00edzen. COUNTRY FINANCIAL ANALYSIS The statutory corporate income tax rate in Argentina was 30% in 2020 but rose to 35% in June 2021. This higher rate will continue to apply. Shell\u2019s upstream activities reported losses because of exploration and development costs incurred mainly in the Neuqu\u00e9n basin. COVID-19 also pushed down domestic and export prices and this contributed to lower profits. As a result, no tax is owed.

Shell also has a 40% interest in the LNG Canada joint venture, which is in the construction phase. COUNTRY FINANCIAL ANALYSIS The statutory corporate income tax rate for Shell in Canada was 24.16% in 2020. The difference between the statutory rate and actual taxes accrued/paid is because of the cycle of upstream projects, whereby large capital expenditures in earlier years generate tax deductions in advance of revenue production. Revenue reductions in 2020 are mainly because of the impact of the pandemic on energy demand. In 2020, the impairment of assets in the upstream unconventional business contributed to the loss before tax. In the table above, the tax refund arises from the settlement of tax litigation relating to prior taxation years.

As a result, $15 million of corporate income tax was paid on the profits of a few income-generating assets. Despite a reduction in total revenues for the year, the overall loss for the year is less compared with the prior year mainly as a result of the remeasurement of certain accounting provisions.

These operating losses were the result of many factors, including investments made in previous years in upstream, manufacturing and chemical businesses during a period of low oil and gas prices. In addition, the decision in 2015 to abandon exploration activities in Alaska and the divestment of a number of non-producing onshore oil and gas leases triggered large tax deductions and generated operating losses. OurPayments to Governments Report from2020also shows payments of around $660 million in royalties and fees. [A] New Energies was rebranded to Renewables and Energy Solutions in 2021.

            "text": "HOW BUSINESSES ARE TAXED Governments use tax to raise revenues.Revenueagencies audit and collect these taxes. Most businesses are subject to tax, regardless of whether they aremultinational corporationsor home-office enterprises. Businesses pay direct taxes to the government and they collect indirect taxes on behalf of governments as a supplier of goods or services. This report details ourcountry-by-country reportdata for 2020, in line with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) standards. It includes the available data for countries and locations in which we have ataxable presence. The data include corporate income tax paid,profit before taxandtangible assets. Tax systems around the world vary and can be complex. However, the tax systems in places where Shell does business have some basic rules in common. MOST BUSINESSES PAY CORPORATE INCOME TAX WHERE PROFITS ARE MADE Corporate income taxis typically due by law in countries where profits are made. This should correspond to where the business activity occurred. The tax due is determined by the tax system of the country or location where that activity took place. Governments design and apply tax rules to the profits generated in their countries and assess what is owed by businesses. Corporate income tax is payable on profits, not revenues. See the table \u201cSimplified example of application of local tax law\u201d for how tax rules are applied to calculate the tax due. Sometimes a multinational enterprise like Shell facesdouble taxation. This is when two countries seek to tax the same business income, resulting in a company being taxed twice. We believe that profit should only be taxed once, in line with the positions of the United Nations and the OECD. In 2020, Shell reported a total loss before tax of $27 billion. Shell companies still paid $3.4 billion [A] in corporate income tax as some of our companies reported a profit in 2020 and/or settled taxes from the previous year. Shell paid a further $3.5 billion in royalties to governments. We also reported a corporate income tax credit of $5.4 billion for 2020. In most countries and locations, thecorporate income taxwe pay differs from the accounting tax credit or charge. This is because tax paid can include payments relating to previous years, the current year and future years. Oureffective tax rate(ETR) is calculated by dividing the tax credit of $5.4 billion by the total loss before taxation of $27 billion, resulting in an ETR of 20.1% for 2020. For comparison, the average corporate income tax rate levied by the 37 countries that were members of the OECD in 2020 was 23.1% [B]. Our ETR is a blend of the different statutory tax rates applied to our various businesses and the different tax laws with which we have sought to comply. In the past three years, our ETR has been higher than the average corporate income tax rate in OECD countries, partly because many governments apply a higher corporate income tax rate to profits made by oil and gas production activities. In some cases, this tax rate can be more than 80%. Our lower ETR for 2020 was the result of asset impairments of $28 billion recorded that year, resulting in an overall tax credit of $5.4 billion. [A] This figure comprises$3.3 billiontaxes paid in 2020, disclosed as part of cash flow from operations,and $132 million of accrued withholding taxes on dividend, interest and royalty payments to Shell entities. It does not include withholding taxes collected by Shell on dividends paid to shareholders.For more details, see the chapter onOur tax data.[B] Source: OECD Tax Database (2020), Table II.1.Statutory corporate income tax rate.

            "text": "TAX GENERATES REVENUE FOR GOVERNMENTS Tax revenues enable governments to pay for public services, such as education, health care and transport. Governments set their fiscal policies and the rules for individual and business taxes. Tax treatments \u2014 such as tax rates, reliefs, exemptions and allowances or disallowances \u2014 are typically approved by national parliaments. Companies must comply with relevant tax laws. Audits and controls by tax authorities help to check whether companies are compliant. Governments can use targeted tax incentives for specific policy objectives, such as protecting the environment, reducing carbon emissions or encouraging advances in areas like research and development. Governments often design incentives to attract domestic and international investment, which can boost economies, create jobs and develop communities. When available and appropriate, we make use oftax incentivesand exemptions where we have a business activity that qualifies. Some governments may choose to lower specific taxes, like corporate income tax. These are deliberate policy decisions and not unintended tax loopholes. Such incentives are designed by governments to attract investment in areas where development may benefit their countries. When governments offer such incentives, they may expect to raise revenues through other types of taxes, such asemployment taxesor export duties. COMPANIES PAY AND COLLECT A RANGE OF TAXES Companies pay and collect a range of taxes. These include: Corporate income tax:direct tax on profits, after operating costs have been deducted from revenues. Value-added tax (VAT):indirect tax due on the purchase of goods and services, typically as a percentage of the sales price of the item or service. Companies administerVATcollection and payment on behalf of governments. Employment tax:companies routinely collect income taxes on employees\u2019 salaries and pay these taxes to the government.Excise duty:an indirect tax on manufacturers due at the point of production rather than sale, which generally forms part of the cost of the product.
