Having reviewed outstanding claims and taking into account legal advice received, the Directors are of the opinion that adequate provisions have been made in the financial statements. 33. Related Party Transactions The parent company of the Group is Jardine Strategic Holdings Limited and the ultimate parent company is Jardine Matheson Holdings Limited (\u2018JMH\u2019). Both companies are incorporated in Bermuda. In the normal course of business the Group undertakes a variety of transactions with JMH and certain of its subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures. The more significant of such transactions are described below. Under the terms of a Management Services Agreement, the management fee payable by the Group was US$1.4 million (2019: US$1.6 million) to Jardine Matheson Limited (\u2018JML\u2019), a wholly-owned subsidiary of JMH, based on 0.5% of the Group\u2019s profit attributable to shareholders in consideration for certain management consultancy services provided by JML. The Group also paid directors\u2019 fees of US$0.4 million in 2020 (2019: US$0.5 million) to JML. The Group rents properties from Hongkong Land Holdings Limited (\u2018HKL\u2019), a subsidiary of JMH. The lease payments paid by the Group to HKL in 2020 were US$2.6 million (2019: US$3.3 million). The Group\u2019s 50%-owned associate, Maxim\u2019s, also paid lease payments of US$10.2 million (2019: US$13.5 million) to HKL in 2020. The Group obtains repairs and maintenance services from Jardine Engineering Corporation (\u2018JEC\u2019), a subsidiary of JMH. The total fees paid by the Group to JEC in 2020 amounted to US$1.2 million (2019: US$4.9 million). Maxim\u2019s supplies ready-to-eat products at arm\u2019s length to certain subsidiaries of the Group. In 2020, these amounted to US$28.8 million (2019: US$32.4 million). In October 2020, the Group disposed of its 100% interest in Rose Pharmacy to its associate, Robinsons Retail, and a loss of US$22.0 million was recognised. Amounts of outstanding balances with associates and joint ventures are included in debtors and creditors, as appropriate. Balances with group companies of JMH at 31st December 2020 and 2019 are immaterial, unsecured, and have no fixed terms of repayment. Details of Directors\u2019 remuneration (being key management personnel compensation) are shown on page 145 under the heading of \u2018Remuneration in 2020\u2019. 99"

Principal Accounting Policies Basis of consolidation (i) The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the Company, its subsidiaries, and the Group\u2019s interests in associates and joint ventures. (ii) A subsidiary is an entity over which the Group has control. The Group controls an entity when the Group is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition includes the fair value at the acquisition date of any contingent consideration. The Group recognises the non-controlling interest\u2019s proportionate share of the recognised identifiable net assets of the acquired subsidiary. In a business combination achieved in stages, the Group remeasures its previously held interest in the acquiree at its acquisition-date fair value and recognises the resulting gain or loss in profit and loss. Changes in a parent\u2019s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in the loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. When control over a previous subsidiary is lost, any remaining interest in the entity is remeasured at fair value and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit and loss. All material intercompany transactions, balances and unrealised surpluses and deficits on transactions between Group companies have been eliminated. (iii) An associate is an entity, not being a subsidiary or a joint venture, over which the Group exercises significant influence. A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement have rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. Associates and joint ventures are included on the equity basis of accounting. Profits and losses resulting from upstream and downstream transactions between the Group and its associates and joint ventures are recognised in the consolidated financial statements only to the extent of unrelated investor\u2019s interests in the associates and joint ventures. (iv) Non-controlling interests represent the proportion of the results and net assets of subsidiaries and their associates and joint ventures not attributable to the Group. (v) The results of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are included or excluded from their effective dates of acquisition or disposal, respectively. The results of entities other than subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are included to the extent of dividends received when the right to receive such dividend is established. 102 Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 2020"

Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, together with all other monetary assets and liabilities expressed in foreign currencies, are translated into United States dollars at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end. Results expressed in foreign currencies are translated into United States dollars at the average rates of exchange ruling during the year, which approximate the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Exchange differences arising from the retranslation of the net investment in foreign subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, and of financial instruments which are designated as hedges of such investments, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity under exchange reserves. On the disposal of these investments, such exchange differences are recognised in profit and loss. All other exchange differences are recognised in profit and loss. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition of a foreign entity after 1st January 2003 are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated into United States dollars at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end. Impairment of non-financial assets Assets that have indefinite useful lives are not subject to amortisation and are tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the assets may be impaired. Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. For the purpose of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there is a separately identifiable cash flow. Cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the units may be impaired. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of an asset\u2019s fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use. Non-financial assets other than goodwill that suffered an impairment are reviewed for possible reversal of the impairment annually. Intangible assets (i) Goodwill represents the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the acquisition-date fair value of any previously held equity interest in the acquiree over the acquisition-date fair value of the Group\u2019s share of the net identifiable assets acquired. Non-controlling interests are measured at their proportionate share of the net identifiable assets at the acquisition date. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets acquired, the difference is recognised directly in profit and loss. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in intangible assets. Goodwill on acquisitions of associates and joint ventures is included in investment in associates and joint ventures. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units for the purpose of impairment testing and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment loss. The profit or loss on disposal of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures is stated after deducting the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. 103"

Principal Accounting Policies continued Intangible assets continued (ii) Other intangible assets, consisting of trademarks and computer software, are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. Amortisation is calculated on the straight-line basis to allocate the cost of intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. Trademarks with indefinite useful lives are not subject to amortisation. Tangible assets and depreciation Freehold properties comprised land and buildings. Freehold land is stated at cost less any impairment. No depreciation is provided on freehold land as it is deemed to have an indefinite life. Buildings on freehold and leasehold land are stated at cost less any accumulated depreciation and impairment. Other tangible assets are stated at cost less amounts provided for depreciation and impairment. Depreciation of tangible assets is calculated on the straight-line basis to allocate the cost of each asset to its residual value over its estimated useful life. The residual values and useful lives are reviewed at each balance sheet date. The estimated useful lives are as follows: Where the carrying amount of a tangible asset is greater than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written down immediately to its recoverable amount. The profit or loss on disposal of tangible assets is recognised by reference to their carrying amounts. Leases At inception of a contract, the Group assesses whether a contract is, or contains, a lease. A contract is, or contains, a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Lease contracts may contain lease and non-lease components. The Group allocates the consideration in the contract to lease and non-lease component based on their relative stand-alone prices. For property leases where the Group is a lessee, it has elected not to separate lease and immaterial non-lease components and accounts for these items as a single lease component. As a lessee, the Group enters into property leases for use as retail stores, distribution centres and offices. The Group recognises right-of-use assets and lease liabilities at the lease commencement dates, that is the dates the underlying assets are available for use. Right-of-use assets are measured at cost, less any accumulated depreciation and impairment, and adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities. The cost of the right-of-use assets includes amounts of the initial measurement of lease liabilities recognised, lease payments made at or before the commencement dates less any lease incentives received, initial direct costs incurred and restoration costs. Right-of-use assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of their estimated useful lives and the lease terms.

            "text": "36. Principal Accounting Policies continued Leases continued The Group also has interests in leasehold land for use in its operations. Lump sum payments are made upfront to acquire these land interests from their previous registered owners or governments in the jurisdictions where the land is located. There are no ongoing payments to be made under the term of the land leases, other than insignificant lease renewal costs or payments based on rateable value set by the relevant government authorities. These payments are stated at cost and are amortised over the term of the lease which includes the renewal period if the lease can be renewed by the Group without significant cost. Lease liabilities are measured at the present value of lease payments to be made over the lease terms. Lease payments include fixed payments (including in-substance fixed payments) less any lease incentives receivable, variable lease payments that depend on an index or a rate, and amounts expected to be paid under residual value guarantees. The lease payments also include the exercise price of a purchase option reasonably certain to be exercised and payments of penalties for terminating a lease, if the lease term reflects the Group exercising that option. The variable lease payments that do not depend on an index or a rate are recognised as expenses in the period on which the event or condition that triggers the payment occurs. In calculating the present value of lease payments, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date if the interest rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable. Lease liabilities are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. After the commencement date, the amount of lease liabilities is increased by the interest costs on the lease liabilities and decreased by lease payments made. The carrying amount of lease liabilities is remeasured when there is a change in the lease term, or there is a change in future lease payments arising from a change in an index or a rate, or there is a change in the Group\u2019s estimate of the amount expected to be payable under a residual guarantee, or there is a change arising from the reassessment of whether the Group will be reasonably certain to exercise an extension or a termination option. When the lease liability is remeasured, a corresponding adjustment is made to the carrying amount of the right-of-use asset, or is recorded in profit or loss if the carrying amount of right-of-use asset has been reduced to zero. The Group has elected not to recognise right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases of low-value assets (i.e. US$5,000 or less) and short-term leases. Low-value assets comprise IT equipment and small items of office furniture. Short-term leases are leases with a lease term of 12 months or less. Lease payments associated with these leases are recognised on a straight-line basis as an expense in profit and loss over the lease term. Lease liabilities are classified as non-current liabilities unless payments are due within 12 months from the balance sheet date. 105"

            "text": "Notes to the Financial Statements 36. Principal Accounting Policies continued Investments The Group\u2019s investments are measured at fair value through profit and loss. The classification is based on the management\u2019s business model and their contractual cash flow characteristics. Equity investments are measured at fair value with fair value gains and losses recognised in profit and loss. Transaction costs of investments carried at fair value through profit and loss are expensed in profit and loss. Investments are classified as non-current assets. All purchases and sales of investments are recognised on the trade date, which is the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the investments. Stocks Stocks, which principally comprise goods held for resale, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a weighted average cost basis and comprises purchase price less rebates. A stock provision is recognised when the net realisable value from sale of the stock is estimated to be lower than the carrying value. Debtors Trade and other debtors, excluding derivative financial instruments, are measured at amortised cost except where the effect of discounting would be immaterial. Provision for impairment is established by considering potential financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the amount of the loss is recognised in arriving at operating profit. When a debtor is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amount previously written off are credited to profit and loss. Debtors with maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date are classified under non-current assets. Cash and cash equivalents For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise deposits with banks, and cash and bank balances, net of bank overdrafts. In the balance sheet, bank overdrafts are included in current borrowings. Provisions Provisions are recognised when the Group has present legal or constructive obligations as a result of past events, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligations, and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligations can be made. Obligations arising from restructuring plans are recognised when detailed formal plans have been established and when there is a valid expectation that such plans will be carried out by either starting to implement them or announcing their main features to those affected by it. Borrowings and borrowing costs Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. In subsequent periods, borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. All borrowing costs are expensed as incurred. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date. 106 Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 2020"

            "text": "36. Principal Accounting Policies continued Current and deferred tax The tax expense for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in profit and loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In this case, the tax is also recognised in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively. The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date in the countries where the Group operates and generates taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation. It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities. Deferred tax is provided, using the liability method, for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying values. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled. Provision for deferred tax is made on the revaluation of certain non-current assets and, in relation to acquisitions, on the difference between the fair value of the net assets acquired and their tax bases. Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets relating to the carry forward of unused tax losses are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the unused tax losses can be utilised. Employee benefits (i) Pension obligations The Group operates a number of defined benefit and defined contribution plans, the assets of which are held in trustee administered funds. Pension accounting costs for defined benefit plans are assessed using the projected unit credit method. Under this method, the costs of providing pensions are charged to profit and loss spreading the regular cost over the service lives of employees in accordance with the advice of qualified actuaries, who carry out a full valuation of major plans every year. The pension obligations are measured as the present value of the estimated future cash outflows by reference to market yields on high quality corporate bonds which have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related liability. Plan assets are measured at fair value. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are recognised in other comprehensive income in the year in which they occur. Past service costs are recognised immediately in profit and loss. The Group\u2019s total contributions relating to the defined contribution plans are charged to profit and loss in the year to which they relate. 107"

Operating profit decreased by 31% to US$57 million, driven primarily by a combination of the shortfall in sales and a sales mix shift towards lower product margin categories. Health and Beauty Total sales for the Health and Beauty Division reduced by 35% to US$2.0 billion as the pandemic impacted customer traffic across our key markets. In North Asia, enforced border closures have led to a virtual elimination of tourism, most notably from the Chinese mainland, which has significantly impacted our Mannings business in Hong Kong and Macau. The resultant decline in sales performance was the primary cause of a significant decrease in operating profit from US$296 million in 2019 to US$66 million. Faced with challenging trading conditions, the Group is focusing on ensuring that its customer value proposition \u2013 from the perspective of pricing, stores and channel to market - remains relevant and competitive. Price investment campaigns have been introduced across our key markets with encouraging results so far. The Group is also managing costs appropriately. Home Furnishings In Home Furnishings, sales for IKEA increased by 9% in the year, as new store openings and strong e-commerce growth offset pandemic related disruption. Operating profit increased by US$28 million to US$71 million, due to a combination of new store profit contribution, lower cost of goods, strong cost controls, reduced pre-opening expenses for new stores and government support. 8 Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 2020 Associates The contribution from 50%-owned Maxim\u2019s declined to US$36 million, from US$82 million in the prior year, as the pandemic, government-imposed restrictions on movement and social distancing measures caused a significant reduction to customer visits to restaurants, as well as leading to some temporary closures. The Group\u2019s share of underlying results in Yonghui grew from US$23 million in 2019 to US$29 million in 2020, primarily due to strong sales growth. Dairy Farm\u2019s share of underlying results in Robinsons Retail fell by 5% to US$14 million. The financial performance of Robinsons Retail in the year was impacted by government restrictions on movement due to the pandemic, particularly with respect to its discretionary formats. Transformation During the year, the Group\u2019s transformation gathered momentum with the completion of a number of key initiatives. Dairy Farm is accelerating the pace of its digital change to adapt to the rapidly changing environment. The launch of Yuu Rewards in July 2020 represented a critical milestone in driving Dairy Farm\u2019s modernisation and digital transformation. Yuu will support a more customer-centric approach across all the Dairy Farm banners and drive an enhanced level of customer engagement. There has also been continuing investment in e-commerce, especially in the Group\u2019s Home Furnishings and Health and Beauty businesses, and the Group is treating this area as a strategic priority. The Group is also investing significantly in existing legacy IT systems to improve the digitisation of in-store operations."

Principal Accounting Policies continued Employee benefits continued (ii) Share-based compensation The Company operates a number of equity-settled employee share option schemes. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of the share options or the share awards in respect of options or awards granted after 7th November 2002 is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the share options or share awards granted as determined on the grant date. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of share options that are expected to become exercisable and the number of share awards which will be vested free of payment. The impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit and loss. Non-current assets and disposal group held for sale Non-current assets and disposal group are classified as held for sale and stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell if their carrying amounts are expected to be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use. Once classified as held for sale, the assets are no longer amortised or depreciated. Derivative financial instruments The Group only enters into derivative financial instruments in order to hedge underlying exposures and not as speculative investments. Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair values. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss is dependent on the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as a hedge of the fair value of a recognised asset or liability (\u2018fair value hedge\u2019), or a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the foreign currency risk on a firm commitment (\u2018cash flow hedge\u2019). At inception of the hedge relationship, the Group documents the economic relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items including whether changes in the cash flows of the hedging instruments are expected to offset changes in the cash flows of hedged items. The Group documents its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking its hedge transactions. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualified as fair value hedges and that are highly effective, are recognised in profit and loss, along with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk. The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of interest rate swaps hedging fixed rate borrowings is recognised in profit and loss within finance costs, together with changes in the fair value of the hedged fixed rate borrowings attributable to interest rate risk. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised in profit and loss. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, the cumulative adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedged item for which the effective interest rate method is used is amortised to profit and loss over the residual period to maturity. 108 Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 2020"

Principal Accounting Policies continued Derivative financial instruments continued Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualified as cash flow hedges and that are highly effective, are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity under hedging reserves. Changes in the fair value relating to the ineffective portion are recognised immediately in profit and loss. Where the hedged item results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or a non-financial liability, the deferred gains and losses are included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability. The deferred amounts are ultimately recognised in profit and loss as the hedged item affects profit and loss. Otherwise, amounts deferred in hedging reserves are transferred to profit and loss in the same periods during which the hedged firm commitment or forecasted transaction affects profit and loss. The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of the interest rate swaps hedging variable rate borrowings is recognised in profit and loss within finance cost at the same time as the interest expense on the hedged borrowings. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in hedging reserves at that time remains in the hedging reserves and is recognised in profit and loss when the committed or forecasted transaction occurs. When a committed or forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in hedging reserves is immediately transferred to profit and loss. Certain derivative transactions, while providing effective economic hedges under the Group\u2019s risk management policies, do not qualify for hedge accounting under the specific rules in IFRS 9. Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS 9 are recognised immediately in profit and loss. The fair value of derivatives which are designated and qualified as effective hedges are classified as non-current assets or liabilities if the remaining maturities of the hedged assets or liabilities are greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. Offsetting financial instruments Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the balance sheet when there is a legally enforceable right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously. The legally enforceable right must not be contingent on future events and must be enforceable in the normal course of business and in the event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the company or the counterparty. Non-trading items Non-trading items are separately identified to provide greater understanding of the Group\u2019s underlying business performance. Items classified as non-trading items include fair value gains and losses on equity investments which are measured at fair value through profit and loss; gains and losses arising from the sale of businesses, investments and properties; impairment of non-depreciable intangible assets, associates and joint ventures, and other investments; provisions for the closure of businesses; acquisition-related costs in business combinations; and other credits and charges of a non-recurring nature that require inclusion in order to provide additional insight into underlying business performance. 109"

            "text": "Notes to the Financial Statements 36. Principal Accounting Policies continued Earnings per share Basic earnings per share are calculated on profit attributable to shareholders and on the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year. The weighted average number excludes the shares held by the Trustee under the Share-based Long-term Incentive Plans. For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, profit attributable to shareholders is adjusted for the effects of the conversion of dilutive potential ordinary shares, and the weighted average number of shares is adjusted for the number of shares which are deemed to be issued for no consideration under the share-based long-term incentive plans based on the average share price during the year. Dividends Dividends proposed or declared after the balance sheet date are not recognised as a liability at the balance sheet date. Sales recognition Sales consist of the fair value of goods sold to customers, net of returns, discounts and sales related taxes. These do not include sales generated by associates and joint ventures. Sale of goods is recognised at the point of sale, when the control of the asset is transferred to customers, and is recorded at the net amount received from customers. Buying income Supplier incentives, rebates and discounts are collectively referred to as buying income. Buying income is recognised when earned by the Group, which occurs when all obligations conditional for earning income have been discharged, and the income can be measured reliably based on the terms of the contract. The income is recognised as a credit within cost of sales. Where the income earned relates to stocks which are held by the Group at period ends, the income is included within the cost of those stocks, and recognised in cost of sales upon sale of those stocks. The accrued value at the reporting date is included in trade debtors or trade creditors, depending on the right of offset. The key types of buying income which the Group receives include: \u2013 Discounts and incentives relate to individual unit sales. \u2013 Sales volume-based incentives based on achieving certain purchases on promotion for an event or a period. \u2013 Conditional incentives subject to satisfaction of certain conditions by the Group. \u2013 Fixed amounts agreed with suppliers for supporting in-store activity. Government grants Grants from government are recognised at their fair values where there is reasonable assurance that the grants will be received, and the Group will comply with the conditions associated with the grants. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred are recognised in the profit and loss as other income on a systematic basis in the period in which the expenses are recognised. Unconditional grants are recognised in the profit and loss as other income when they become receivable. Grants related to assets are deducted in arriving at the carrying value of the related assets. 110 Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 2020"

Standards and Amendments Issued But Not Yet Effective A number of amendments effective for accounting periods beginning after 2020 have been published and will be adopted by the Group from their effective dates. The Group is currently assessing the potential impact of these standard and amendments but expects the adoption will not have a significant impact on the Group\u2019s consolidated financial statements. The more important amendments are set out below. (i) Interest Rate Benchmark Reform \u2013 Phase 2: Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39, IFRS 7, IFRS 4 and IFRS 16 (effective from 1st January 2021) provides practical expedients as a result of the reform which affect the measurement of financial assets, financial liabilities and lease liabilities, and a number of reliefs for hedging relationships. The Group will apply the amendments from 1st January 2021, but it is not expected the adoption will have a significant impact on the Group\u2019s consolidated financial statements. (ii) Amendment to IFRS 9: \u2018Fees in the \u201910 per cent\u2019 Test for Derecognition of Financial Liabilities\u2019 (effective from 1st January 2022) clarifies the requirement to derecognise the original financial liability and recognise a new financial liability where there is an exchange between an existing borrower and lender of debt instrument with substantially different terms. The amendment clarifies that the terms are substantially different if the discounted present value of the cash flows under the new terms using the original effective interest rate, including any fees paid net of any fees received, is at least 10 per cent different from the discounted present value of the remaining cash flows of the original financial liability. The Group will apply the amendment from 1st January 2022, but it is not expected the adoption will have a significant impact on the Group\u2019s consolidated financial statements. (iii) Amendments to IAS 37: Onerous Contracts \u2013 Cost of Fulfilling a Contract (effective from 1st January 2022) clarifies that for the purpose of assessing whether a contract is onerous, the cost of fulfilling the contract includes both the incremental costs of fulfilling that contract and an allocation of other costs that relate directly to fulfilling contracts. The Group will apply the amendments from 1st January 2022, but it is not expected the adoption will have a significant impact on the Group\u2019s consolidated financial statements. 111"

            "text": "Notes to the Financial Statements 38. Financial Risk Management Financial risk factors The Group\u2019s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group\u2019s treasury function co-ordinates financial risk management policies and their implementation on a group-wide basis. The Group\u2019s treasury policies are designed to manage the financial impact of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates and to minimise the Group\u2019s financial risks. The Group uses derivative financial instruments, principally interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency options as appropriate for hedging transactions and managing the Group\u2019s assets and liabilities in accordance with the Group\u2019s financial risk management policies. Financial derivative contracts are executed between third party banks and the Group\u2019s entity that is directly exposed to the risk being hedged. Hedge accounting is applied to remove the accounting mismatch between the hedging instrument and the hedged item. The effective portion of the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument is deferred into the cash flow hedge reserve through other comprehensive income and will be recognised in profit and loss when the hedged item affects profit and loss. In general, the volatility in profit or loss can be reduced by applying hedge accounting. Hedge effectiveness is determined at the inception of the hedge relationship, and through periodic prospective effectiveness assessments to ensure that an economic relationship exists between the hedged item and hedging instrument. For hedges of foreign currency purchases, the Group enters into hedge relationships where the critical terms of the hedging instrument match exactly with the terms of the hedged item. The Group assesses whether the derivative designated in each hedging relationship has been and expected to be effective in offsetting changes in cash flow of the hedged item using the hypothetical derivative method. Ineffectiveness may arise if the timing of the forecast transaction changes from what was originally estimated for hedges of foreign currency purchases, or if there are changes in the credit risk of the Group or the derivative counterparty. The Group enters into interest rate swaps that have similar critical terms as the hedged item, such as reference rate, reset dates, payment dates, maturities and notional amount. The Group does not hedge 100% of its loans, therefore the hedged item is identified as a proportion of the outstanding loans up to the notional amount of the swaps. As all critical terms matched during the year, effective economic relationship existed between the swaps and the loans. Hedge ineffectiveness for interest rate swaps is assessed using the same principles as for hedges of foreign currency purchases. It may occur due to: (i) The credit value/debit value adjustment on the interest rate swaps which is not matched by the loan; (ii) Differences in critical terms between the interest rate swaps and loans; and (iii) The effects of the forthcoming reforms to IBOR, because these might take effect at a different time and have a different impact on the hedged item (the floating-rate debt) and the hedging instrument (the interest rate swap used to hedge the debt). The ineffectiveness during 2020 in relation to interest rate swaps was not material while there was no interest rate swap in 2019. 112 Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 2020"

            "text": "38. Financial Risk Management continued Financial risk factors continued (i) Market risk Foreign exchange risk Entities within the Group are exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions, net investments in foreign operations and net monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in a currency that is not the entity\u2019s functional currency. The Group uses forward foreign exchange contracts and foreign currency options in a consistent manner to hedge firm and anticipated foreign exchange commitments and manage foreign exchange risk arising from future commercial transactions. The purpose of these hedges is to mitigate the impact of movements in foreign exchange rates on assets and liabilities and the profit and loss account of the Group. Currency risks as defined by IFRS 7 arise on account of monetary assets and liabilities being denominated in a currency that is not the functional currency. There are no significant monetary balances held by Group companies at 31st December 2020 that are denominated in a non-functional currency. Differences resulting from the translation of financial statements into the Group\u2019s presentation currency are not taken into consideration. Interest rate risk The Group is exposed to interest rate risk through the impact of rate changes on interest-bearing assets and liabilities. These exposures are managed partly by using natural hedges that arise from offsetting interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities, and partly through fixed rate borrowings and the use of derivative financial instruments including interest rate swaps. The Group monitors interest rate exposure on a regular basis by currency and business unit, taking into consideration proposed financing and hedging arrangements. The Group\u2019s guideline is to maintain 40% to 60% of its long-term non-working capital gross borrowings in fixed rate instruments. At 31st December 2020, the Group\u2019s fixed rate borrowings were 9% on total borrowings, with an average tenor of 0.2 year. At 31st December 2019, the Group had no outstanding fixed rate borrowings. The interest rate profile of the Group\u2019s borrowings after taking into account hedging transactions is set out in note 19. Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that changes in market interest rates will impact cash flows arising from variable rate financial instruments. Borrowings at floating rates therefore expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. The Group manages this risk by entering into interest rate swaps for a maturity of up to three years. Interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from floating rate to fixed rate. Details of interest rate swaps are set out in note 30. Fair value interest rate risk is the risk that the value of a financial asset or liability and derivative financial instruments will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group manages its fair value interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swaps which have the economic effect of converting borrowings from fixed rate to floating rate, to maintain the Group\u2019s fixed rate instruments within the Group\u2019s guideline. 113"

            "text": "Notes to the Financial Statements 38. Financial Risk Management continued Financial risk factors continued (i) Market risk continued Interest rate risk continued At 31st December 2020, if interest rates had been 100 basis points higher/lower with all other variables held constant, the Group\u2019s profit after tax would have been US$7.7 million (2019: US$9.2 million) higher/lower, and hedging reserves would have been US$2.5 million lower/higher (2019: no change), as a result of fair value changes to cash flow hedges. The sensitivity analysis has been determined assuming that the change in interest rates had occurred at the balance sheet date and had been applied to the exposure to interest rate risk for both derivative and non-derivative financial instruments in existence at that date. The 100 basis point increase or decrease represents management\u2019s assessment of a reasonably possible change in those interest rates which have the most impact on the Group, specifically the Hong Kong, United States and Malaysian rates, over the period until the next annual balance sheet date. In the case of effective fair value hedges, changes in the fair value of the hedged items caused by interest rate movements balance out in the profit and loss account against changes in the fair value of the hedging instruments. Changes in market interest rates affect the interest income or expense of non-derivative variable-interest financial instruments, the interest payments of which are not designated as hedged items of cash flow hedges against interest rate risks. As a consequence, they are included in the calculation of profit after tax sensitivities. Changes in the market interest rate of financial instruments that were designated as hedging instruments in a cash flow hedge to hedge payment fluctuations resulting from interest rate movements affect the hedging reserves and are therefore taken into consideration in the equity-related sensitivity calculations. (ii) Credit risk The Group\u2019s credit risk is primarily attributable to deposits with banks and derivative financial instruments with a positive fair value. The Group has credit policies in place and the exposures to these credit risks are monitored on an ongoing basis. The Group manages its deposits with banks and transactions involving derivative financial instruments by monitoring credit ratings and capital adequacy ratios of counterparties, and limiting the aggregate risk to any individual counterparty. The utilisation of credit limits is regularly monitored. Similarly, transactions involving derivative financial instruments are with banks with sound credit ratings and capital adequacy ratios. In developing countries it may be necessary to deposit money with banks that have a lower credit rating, however, the Group only enters into derivative transactions with counterparties which have credit ratings of at least investment grade. Management does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations. Sales to customers are made in cash or by major credit cards. The maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial asset in the balance sheet after deducting any impairment allowance. (iii) Liquidity risk Prudent liquidity risk management includes managing the profile of debt maturities and funding sources, maintaining sufficient cash and ensuring the availability of funding from an adequate amount of committed credit facilities and the ability to close out market positions. The Group\u2019s ability to fund its existing and prospective debt requirements is managed by maintaining diversified funding sources with adequate committed funding lines from high quality lenders, and by monitoring rolling short-term forecasts of the Group\u2019s cash and gross debt on the basis of expected cash flows. Long-term cash flows are projected to assist with the Group\u2019s long-term debt financing plans. In addition, the Group has implemented a global liquidity cash pooling scheme, which enables the Group to manage and optimise its working capital funding requirement on a daily basis. 114 Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 2020"

Financial Risk Management continued Capital management The Group\u2019s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern whilst seeking to maximise benefits to shareholders and other stakeholders. Capital is equity as shown in the consolidated balance sheet plus net debt. The Group actively and regularly reviews and manages its capital structure to ensure optimal capital structure and shareholder returns, by taking into consideration the future capital requirements of the Group and capital efficiency, prevailing and projected profitability, projected operating cash flows, projected capital expenditures and projected strategic investment opportunities. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, repurchase Company shares, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. The Group monitors capital on the basis of the Group\u2019s consolidated gearing ratio and consolidated interest cover. The gearing ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total equity. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings less cash and bank balances. Interest cover is calculated as the sum of underlying operating profit, before the deduction of depreciation and impairment charges of right-of-use assets, net of actual lease payments, and share of results of associates and joint ventures, divided by net financing charges excluding interest on lease liabilities. The Group does not have a defined gearing ratio or interest cover benchmark or range. Fair value estimation (i) Financial instruments that are measured at fair value For financial instruments that are measured at fair value in the balance sheet, the corresponding fair value measurements are disclosed by level of the following fair value measurement hierarchy: (a) Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (\u2018quoted prices in active markets\u2019) The fair values of listed securities are based on quoted prices in active markets at the balance sheet date. (b) Inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly (\u2018observable current market transactions\u2019) The fair values of derivative financial instruments are determined using rates quoted by the Group\u2019s bankers at the balance sheet date. The rates for interest rate swaps and forward foreign exchange contracts are calculated by reference to market interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The fair values of unlisted equity investments, mainly include club debentures, are determined using prices quoted by brokers at the balance sheet date. The ratios at 31st December 2020 and 2019 are as follows: Gearing ratio (%) Interest cover (times) 116 Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 2020 2020 61 15 2019 66 12"

Over 600 items have already been launched across banners and markets at lower prices. The future growth of Own Brand will allow the Group to leverage scale and gain competitive advantage. A number of price investment campaigns were introduced across key banners in the year to enhance our customer value proposition across our regions. In Singapore, the Group\u2019s price reinvestment campaign coincided with the relaunch of the Giant banner with a major rebrand and space reallocation in refreshed or refitted stores. Initial performance has been encouraging. Business developments The Group divested Wellcome Taiwan during the year. In October, Dairy Farm deepened its strategic partnership with Philippines-listed multi-format retail group, Robinsons Retail, by combining its interests in the wholly-owned subsidiary Rose Pharmacy through a sale to Robinsons Retail\u2019s subsidiary Southstar Drug. As at 31st December 2020, Dairy Farm, including associates and joint ventures, operated 9,997 stores across all formats, compared with 10,012 stores at 31st December 2019 on a continuing basis. People Our businesses are operating in extraordinary circumstances and our people are facing huge challenges. We would like to express our deep gratitude for the continuing dedication and resolve of our team members in putting our customers first during these difficult times. The Group made significant investments in the year to address the challenges of COVID-19 and support employees, customers and the community. These costs were offset by support received from governments in several of our key markets, which has helped maintain employment in a number of our businesses.

            "text": "Notes to the Financial Statements 39. Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements Estimates and judgements used in preparing the financial statements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable according to circumstances and conditions available. The existing and potential impacts arising from the COVID-19 pandemic have been considered when applying estimates and assumptions in the preparation of the financial statements, including the Group\u2019s assessment of impairment of assets. Given the uncertainty of the impact of COVID-19, the actual results may differ from these accounting estimates. The estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and income and expenses are discussed below. Acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures The initial accounting on the acquisition of subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures involves identifying and determining the fair values to be assigned to the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entities. The fair values of tangible assets and right-of-use assets are determined by independent valuers by reference to market prices or present value of expected net cash flows from the assets. Any changes in the assumptions used and estimates made in determining the fair values, and management\u2019s ability to measure reliably the contingent liabilities of the acquired entity will impact the carrying amount of these assets and liabilities. On initial acquisition or acquisition of further interests in an entity, an assessment of the level of control or influence exercised by the Group is required. For entities where the Group has a shareholding of less than 50%, an assessment of the Group\u2019s level of voting rights, board representation and other indicators of influence is performed to consider whether the Group has de facto control, requiring consolidation of that entity, or significant influence, requiring classification as an associate, or joint control, requiring classification as a joint venture. Leases Liabilities and the corresponding right-of-use assets arising from leases are initially measured at the present value of the lease payments at the commencement date, discounted using the interest rates implicit in the leases, or if that rate cannot be readily determinable, the Group uses the incremental borrowing rate. The Group generally uses the incremental borrowing rate as the discount rate. The Group applies the incremental borrowing rate with reference to the rate of interest that the Group would have to pay to borrow, over a similar term as that of the lease, the funds necessary to obtain an asset of a similar value to the right-of-use asset in the country where it is located. Lease payments to be made during the lease term will be included in the measurement of a lease liability. The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease, together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised, or any period covered by an option to terminate the lease, if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised. The Group has the option, under some of its leases to lease the assets for additional terms. The Group applies judgement in evaluating whether it is reasonably certain to exercise the option to renew. That is, the Group considers all relevant factors that create an economic incentive for it to exercise the renewal. After the commencement date, the Group reassesses the lease term if there is a significant event or change in circumstances that is within its control and affects its ability to exercise or not to exercise the option to renew. The assessment of whether the Group is reasonably certain to exercise the options impacts the lease terms, which significantly affects the amount of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets recognised. Pension obligations The present value of the pension obligations depends on a number of factors that are determined on an actuarial basis using a number of assumptions. The assumptions used in determining the net cost/income for pensions include the discount rate. Any changes in these assumptions will impact the carrying amount of pension obligations. 120 Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 2020"

            "text": "39. Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements continued Pension obligations continued The Group determines the appropriate discount rate at the end of each year. This is the interest rate that should be used to determine the present value of estimated future cash outflows expected to be required to settle the pension obligations. In determining the appropriate discount rate, the Group considers the interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension obligations. Other key assumptions for pension obligations are based in part on current market conditions. Impairment of assets The Group tests annually whether goodwill and other assets that have indefinite useful lives suffered any impairment. Other assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of an asset or a cash-generating unit is determined based on the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use, calculated on the basis of management\u2019s assumptions and estimates. Changing the key assumptions, including the discount rates or the growth rate assumptions in the cash flow projections, could materially affect the value-in-use calculations. Income taxes The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Significant judgement is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. Where the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the current and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made. Provision of deferred tax follows the way management expects to recover or settle the carrying amount of the related assets or liabilities, which the management may expect to recover through use, sale or combination of both. Accordingly, deferred tax will be calculated at income tax rate, capital gains tax rate or combination of both. Recognition of deferred tax assets, which principally relate to tax losses, depends on the management\u2019s expectation of future taxable profit that will be available against which the tax losses can be utilised. The outcome of their actual utilisation may be different. Buying income The Group receives buying income, including supplier incentives, rebates and discounts, which are deducted from cost of sales on an accrual basis. Management is required to make estimates in determining the expected entitlement which has been earned up to the balance sheet date for each relevant supplier contract and the timing of recognition. There is limited estimation involved in recognising income for fixed amounts agreed with suppliers. In 2020, the Group recognised a charge in underlying profit for the reversal of buying income recognised incorrectly in prior years. The Group has assessed the impact of buying income recognised incorrectly in prior years on the consolidated financial statements and determined that the impact was not material to the consolidated financial statements of any prior financial years and therefore did not require a prior year restatement. The amount has been recorded through underlying results. Non-trading items The Group uses underlying business performance in its internal financial reporting to distinguish between the underlying profits and non-trading items. The identification of non-trading items requires judgement by management, but follows the consistent methodology as set out in the Group\u2019s accounting policies. 121"

Capability of the audit in detecting irregularities, including fraud Irregularities, including fraud, are instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations. We design procedures in line with our responsibilities, outlined in the Auditors\u2019 responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section, to detect material misstatements in respect of irregularities, including fraud. The extent to which our procedures are capable of detecting irregularities, including fraud, is detailed below. Based on our understanding of the Group and industry, we identified that the principal risks of non-compliance with laws and regulations related to, but were not limited to, the Companies Act 1981 (Bermuda), the Listing Rules, tax regulations, employment regulation, health and safety regulation and equivalent local laws and regulations applicable to significant reporting component teams, and we considered the extent to which non-compliance might have a material effect on the financial statements. We also considered those laws and regulations that have a direct impact on the preparation of the financial statements such as the Companies Act 1981 (Bermuda). 123"

            "text": "Independent Auditors\u2019 Report We evaluated management\u2019s incentives and opportunities for fraudulent manipulation of the financial statements (including the risk of override of controls), and determined that the principal risks were related to the posting of inappropriate journal entries and management bias in accounting estimates and judgements. The Group engagement team shared this risk assessment with the component auditors so that they could include appropriate audit procedures in response to such risks in their work. Audit procedures performed by the Group engagement team and/or component auditors included: \u2022 Gaining an understanding of the legal and regulatory framework applicable to the Group and the industries in which its businesses operate, and considering the risk of any acts by the Group which may be contrary to applicable laws and regulations, including fraud. \u2022 Discussions with management and internal audit, including consideration of known or suspected instances of non-compliance with laws and regulation and fraud; \u2022 Understanding the results of whistleblowing procedures and related investigations. We focused on known and suspected instances of non-compliance with laws and regulations that could give rise to a material misstatement in the Group and company financial statements, including, but were not limited to, the Companies Act 1981 (Bermuda), the Listing Rules, tax legislation, employment regulation, health and safety regulation and equivalent local laws and regulations applicable to significant reporting component teams. \u2022 Review of reporting component auditors\u2019 work, including any matters reported by component auditors\u2019 relating to non-compliance with laws and regulations or fraud; \u2022 Challenging assumptions and judgements made by management in their significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. In particular, in relation to the impairment assessments related to the carrying value of investments in associates and joint ventures, the impairment assessments related to the carrying value of intangible assets, tangible assets and right-of-use assets, and recognition of buying income (see related key audit matters below); \u2022 We did not identify any key audit matters relating to irregularities, including fraud. As in all of our audits we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including testing journals, and evaluated whether there was evidence of bias by the Directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. There are inherent limitations in the audit procedures described above and the further removed non-compliance with laws and regulations is from the events and transactions reflected in the financial statements, the less likely we would become aware of it. Also, the risk of not detecting a material misstatement due to fraud is higher than the risk of not detecting one resulting from error, as fraud may involve deliberate concealment by, for example, forgery or intentional misrepresentations, or through collusion. Key audit matters Key audit matters are those matters that, in the auditors\u2019 professional judgement, were of most significance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and include the most significant assessed risks of material misstatement (whether or not due to fraud) identified by the auditors, including those which had the greatest effect on: the overall audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team. These matters, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures thereon, were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit. 124 Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 2020"

Right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, which was a key audit matter last year, is no longer included because this key audit matter was relevant for the adoption of IFRS 16 \u2018Leases\u2019 last year. Otherwise, the key audit matters below are consistent with last year. 125 Key audit matter Carrying value of investment in Robinsons Retail Holdings Limited (\u2018Robinsons Retail\u2019) Refer to note 39 (Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements) and note 12 (Associates and Joint Ventures) to the financial statements. As at 31st December 2020, the carrying value of the Group\u2019s 20% investment in its associate, Robinsons Retail, was higher than its fair value based on its prevailing market share price. Management undertook an impairment assessment, as required by accounting standards as there was an indicator of impairment. There is inherent estimation uncertainty in determining the recoverable amount of the carrying value of the investment as significant judgements are required by management in preparing their value-in-use models, particularly management\u2019s view on key internal inputs and external market conditions which impact future cash flows, the discount rate and the long-term growth rate. We focused on the carrying value of the Group\u2019s investment in Robinsons Retail due to the significant judgements and estimates involved to determine whether the carrying value of the investment was supportable. How our audit addressed the key audit matter We assessed the inherent risk of material misstatement by considering the degree of estimation uncertainty and the judgement involved in determining the assumptions to be applied. We have understood and reviewed management\u2019s impairment assessment process, including what indicators of impairment had been identified and the appropriateness of the valuation model used, including the assessment of the future impact of COVID-19. As we identified a heightened risk of impairment we performed the following procedures. We benchmarked and challenged key assumptions in management\u2019s valuation model used to determine recoverable amount against market data. This included whether the assumptions of projected cash flows of the business, the long-term growth rate and the discount rate were appropriate, using our knowledge and experience. We tested the discounted cash flow model used in the assessment, checked the accuracy of the calculations, compared historical budgeted performance with actual results and agreed the figures used with the detailed management approved budgets to assess the reasonableness of the cash flows used in the model. Our challenge focused particularly on the discount rate and long-term growth rate used. With the support of our valuations specialists, we compared the discount rates used with the range of typical discount rates used in similar businesses and, considered whether management had incorporated all relevant macro-economic and country-specific factors, as well as those specific to Robinsons Retail, in determining its discount rate."

            "text": "Key audit matter Buying income Refer to note 36 (Principal Accounting Policies) and note 39 (Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements) to the financial statements. The Group has arrangements with suppliers whereby volume-based discounts and incentives, promotional and marketing incentives and various other rebates and discounts are earned in connection with the purchase of goods for resale from those suppliers. As such, the Group recognises a net deduction from cost of sales as a result of amounts receivable from suppliers. The individual supplier arrangements in place across the Group vary in nature. The majority of buying income is driven by volume-based measures or event-driven schemes, with the remainder being ad-hoc and promotional buying income. Buying income is material to the financial statements and given the types of buying income arrangements as well as various performance criteria which differ by suppliers, we identified buying income as a key audit matter. The level of judgement in each category of buying income is noted below: Volume-based income Volume-based rebates are generally driven by achieving purchase volume targets set with individual suppliers for specific products over a pre-set period of time. In instances where the rebate agreement does not fully coincide with the period-end, the key judgement that we focused on was the estimate of expected purchase volumes in the period covered by the rebate agreement. Ad-hoc and promotional income The remainder of the Group\u2019s buying income is associated with ad-hoc and promotional income. The nature of this income and the manner in which it is recognised varies depending on the nature of the agreement with the individual supplier. The income is earned as the relevant performance criteria are met. Due to the significant number of transactions and individual agreements and the potential for manual calculations, we focused effort on assessing the appropriateness of amounts recognised. Our focus was on the underlying agreements associated with the income earned, and assessing whether the income recorded was in accordance with those agreements. How our audit addressed the key audit matter We gained an understanding of and evaluated the key controls in place within the buying income process and tested those controls in certain components of the business. We performed a detailed analytical review of buying income by type and location to identify whether there were any unusual trends were present. On a sample basis: \u2022 we traced the reconciliation of supplier deductions or payments recognised in the income statement to cash receipts or supplier contracts; \u2022 we selected amounts recognised in debtors and creditors and agreed the amounts to supporting documentation. Where buying income amounts were offset against outstanding amounts payable to suppliers we assessed whether there was a right to offset, based on the contractual terms with suppliers; \u2022 we assessed whether the performance criteria of the items selected had been met and where buying income amounts were estimated, that there was appropriate supporting evidence in determining those estimates; \u2022 we assessed the appropriateness of manual journal entries and adjustments associated with buying income by tracing them to supporting documentation; and \u2022 we assessed supplier dispute logs and management\u2019s supplier statement reconciliations to determine whether material disputes or disagreements with suppliers existed. Where significant disputes or disagreements existed, we understood the nature of these disputes through discussions with management and obtained documentation to assess whether the amounts recognised by management were reasonable. Overall, we found the amounts recognised in the financial statements in respect of buying income to be supportable. We assessed the adequacy of the disclosures related to the buying income in the context of IFRS disclosure requirements and consider the disclosures to be appropriate. 127"

The Group has had to constantly adapt the management of its operations against a backdrop of varying levels of community infection rates and rapidly evolving customer behaviours... Despite these challenges, the Group\u2019s transformation plan executed over the past three years has supported our ability to adapt to the ever-changing environment. In addition, the diversity of the Group\u2019s business mix from the perspective of both direct and indirectly managed businesses, formats and geographies has provided effective insulation from unprecedented trading conditions.\u201d Introduction 2020 has been an unprecedented and challenging year for Dairy Farm. The Group has had to constantly adapt the management of its operations against a backdrop of varying levels of community infection rates and rapidly evolving customer behaviours. This was done in the context of different and changing approaches to managing the pandemic by governments in the regions where we operate, as well as the need to invest in and ensure our team members\u2019 safety and well-being. Despite these challenges, the Group\u2019s transformation plan executed over the past three years has supported our ability to adapt to the ever-changing environment. In addition, the diversity of the Group\u2019s business mix from the perspective of both direct and indirectly managed businesses, formats and geographies has provided effective insulation from unprecedented trading conditions. Underlying operating profit for the Group\u2019s subsidiaries reduced by 6% in the year, with strong profit growth in Grocery Retail and Home Furnishings offset by reduced profitability in Convenience Stores and Health and Beauty. The contribution from key associates decreased materially, primarily due to lower profitability from Maxim\u2019s (where we own 50%), which was significantly impacted by disruption caused by COVID-19. Total underlying net profit for the Group reduced by 14% to US$276 million. 10 Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 2020 Five strategic imperatives 1) Growth in China 7-Eleven South China opened over 200 additional new stores during the year despite the challenges of movement restrictions. China\u2019s extremely tight lockdown regime significantly impacted foot traffic in the early part of the year, with up to 500 stores having to close for prolonged periods. Subsequently, when movement restrictions became less severe, regulations prohibiting the sale of Ready-to-Eat products impacted sales recovery. Despite the challenges posed by trading conditions, strong execution of product innovation and promotions led to a significant improvement in sales in the second half of the year. During the year, 7-Eleven South China began a project to transform its legacy IT systems with a new end-to-end agile IT solution, to support both an improved customer shopping experience and its future growth ambitions. Mannings China\u2019s sales performance was impacted significantly in the first quarter as restrictions on movement led to reduced traffic. However, the business reported improving like-for-like sales trends throughout 2020. Mannings China continues to execute its space optimisation plan with greater focus around the Greater Bay Area, where Mannings has stronger brand awareness and can leverage the existing scale of 7-Eleven. E-commerce growth continues to be strong, with penetration now over double digits."

The Group has recognised asset impairment charges of US$103 million in relation to the Indonesian Grocery Retail business for the year ended 31st December 2020 following a store performance review. These costs comprise of US$39 million relating to the impairment of intangible assets and US$64 million for the impairment of tangible assets, impairment of right-of-use assets, redundancy provisions, and other provisions. As required by accounting standards, management performed a detailed impairment assessment of the intangible assets, tangible assets and right-of-use assets having identified impairment indicators arising from the financial performance of the Indonesian Grocery Retail business.

Impairment of tangible assets and right-of-use assets were recorded in respect of underperforming or loss-making locations, where management identified that the expected future cash inflows were lower than the contractual lease obligations. The impairment charges were calculated based on the terms of rental agreements and the earlier of the remaining lease term or possible exit date. Determining the provisions required management to make judgements over the key inputs and assumptions, including the amount and timing of expected costs that will be incurred. 128 How our audit addressed the key audit matter We assessed the inherent risk of material misstatement by considering the degree of estimation uncertainty and the judgement involved in determining assumptions to be applied. We have understood and reviewed management\u2019s impairment assessment process for assessing the carrying value of intangible assets, tangible assets and right-of-use assets, including the identification of indicators of impairment and appropriateness of the valuation models used, including the assessment of the future impact of COVID-19. We have considered and scrutinised management\u2019s store performance review for the Indonesian Grocery Retail business. On a sample basis, we agreed the carrying value of tangible assets and right-of-use assets that were assessed for impairment to underlying financial records. We tested the discounted cash flow models used by management to determine the amount of intangible asset, tangible asset and right-of-use asset impairment required. We assessed the cash flow forecasts by comparing historical budgeted performance to actual results, agreeing the financial information used to the Board approved budget, and checked the accuracy of the calculations. We tested the accuracy and completeness of the data used by management in the models by agreeing key inputs, such as the cash flow forecasts for individual stores, to the detailed budget approved by the Board. In addition, on a sample basis, we agreed the inputs used in the calculations to the underlying lease contracts. We assessed the key inputs and assumptions used by management in calculating the redundancy and other provisions with reference to actual historical performance and underlying contractual agreements. We evaluated whether the assumptions were appropriate based on the evidence available. Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 2020"

            "text": "Key audit matter Impairment of assets in PT Hero continued IT environment The Group is heavily reliant on its IT infrastructure and systems for the daily operations of its business. We focused on IT systems as the systems across the Group are complex and there are varying levels of standardisation and integration between new and legacy IT systems. The systems are vital to the ongoing operations of the business and to the integrity of the financial reporting process. How our audit addressed the key audit matter We considered that the key assumptions used, and calculations prepared by management to determine the intangible asset, tangible asset and right-of-use asset impairments, redundancy provisions and other provisions to be supportable based on available evidence. We assessed the adequacy of the disclosures related to the carrying value of intangible assets, tangible assets and right-of-use assets and the other provisions made in the context of IFRS disclosure requirements and agreed disclosures in the financial statements to the models tested and the assumptions applied in those models. We are satisfied that appropriate disclosure has been made. We updated our understanding of the IT environment through discussions with management and walked-through the key financial processes to understand the relevant IT systems which were integral to the Group\u2019s controls over financial reporting. These procedures allowed us to determine which IT systems, processes and controls to rely upon. We tested key controls over user access to programs and data; program development; program changes made to IT systems; and IT operations. The key automated controls operating within IT systems that we rely on were also tested. Where we noted deficiencies which affected IT systems or controls on which we planned to place reliance, we tested mitigating controls or extended the scope of our substantive audit procedures. 129"

            "text": "Independent Auditors\u2019 Report Key audit matter Impact of COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the performance of the Group. The extent of the negative impact of the pandemic on future trading performance is difficult to predict. Therefore, there is inherent uncertainty in determining the impact of the pandemic on certain aspects of the financial statements. The key impact of COVID-19 on the financial statements are: \u2022 Management\u2019s assessment of the carrying values of the Group\u2019s goodwill in subsidiaries and the carrying values of its investments in associates and joint ventures as a result of a reduction to the valuations at the year end, in part arising due to the impact of COVID-19 on the underlying businesses, as described in the related key audit matter above. In particular, we focused on the carrying value of goodwill held in respect of PT Hero and the carrying value of the Group\u2019s investment in its associate, Robinsons Retail. \u2022 The budgets and models supporting the tangible assets and right-of-use assets reflect management\u2019s best estimate of the impact of COVID-19. The assumptions applied in this analysis have been determined internally, but they incorporate other third-party data sources where relevant. \u2022 The models and related assumptions that underpin management\u2019s going concern assessment. Having considered the impact of COVID-19 on liquidity models, management has concluded that the Group remains a going concern, and that there is no material uncertainty in respect of this conclusion. Management\u2019s way of working, including the operation of controls, has been impacted by COVID-19 as a result of a large number of staff working remotely. 130 Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 2020 How our audit addressed the key audit matter Our procedures in respect of impairment assessments related to carrying value of the Group\u2019s investment in Robinsons Retail and impairment of the assets in PT Hero are covered in the related key audit matters above. We performed procedures to assess the recoverability of tangible assets and right-of-use assets. Where these involved management\u2019s impairment assessment, we assessed the appropriateness of valuation models used and assumptions applied. With the support of our valuation specialists, we benchmarked and challenged key assumptions in management\u2019s valuation models used to determine recoverable amounts against market data. This included whether assumptions of projected cash flows of stores, long-term growth rates and discount rates were appropriate taking into account the impact of COVID-19, using our knowledge and experience, for the tangible assets and right-of-use assets under review. We tested the discounted cash flow models used in the assessments, checked the accuracy of the calculations, compared historical budgeted performance with actual results to assess the reasonableness of the cash flows used in the models. We performed an independent sensitivity analysis on the key assumptions and considered a range of alternative outcomes to determine the sensitivity of the valuation models to changes in assumptions. Where the recoverable amount was lower than the carrying amount of the cash generating unit (\u2018CGU\u2019), we checked the calculation of the impairment charge recognised. We found that the judgements and estimates made by management to determine the discount rates, long-term growth rates and cash flows used in the valuation models were reasonable."

Our conclusions in respect of going concern are set out separately within this report. We performed additional procedures to assess any control implications arising from the impact of COVID-19, including inquiries with respect to the operation of IT and business process controls, and whether there has been any impact on the Group. We instructed our component teams to perform additional procedures to understand if there were any changes to management\u2019s planned operation of controls or monitoring activities. We did not identify any evidence of material deterioration in the control environment. We increased the frequency and extent of our oversight over component audit teams, using video conferencing and remote working paper reviews, to satisfy ourselves as to the appropriateness of audit work performed at significant and material components. We considered the appropriateness of disclosures in the financial statements in respect of the impact of the current environment and the increased uncertainty on certain accounting estimates and consider these to be appropriate. 131"

            "text": "Independent Auditors\u2019 Report How we tailored the audit scope We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, taking into account the structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the industries in which it operates. The Group\u2019s accounting processes are structured around finance functions, which are responsible for their own accounting records and controls, which in turn report financial information to the Group\u2019s finance function in Hong Kong to enable them to prepare consolidated financial statements. In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed by members of the Group engagement team or by component auditors from member firms within the PwC Network operating under our instruction. Where the work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work at those components to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the financial statements as a whole. The Group engagement team was involved in the significant reporting entities in scope for Group reporting during the audit cycle through a combination of meetings and conference calls. Due to the current restrictions on travel and social distancing measures, enacted as a response to COVID-19, the lead Group audit partner and other senior team members were involved throughout the year through the regular use of conference calls and other forms of communication to direct and oversee the audit, including the remote review of the work of component teams. A full scope audit was performed on seven entities including six subsidiaries and one associate, Maxim\u2019s. These entities, together with procedures performed on central functions and at the Group level (on the consolidation and other areas of significant judgement), accounted for 89% of the Group\u2019s revenue, 86% of the Group\u2019s profit before tax, and 82% of the Group\u2019s underlying profit before tax. This gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the financial statements as a whole. Materiality The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures on the individual financial statement line items and disclosures and in evaluating the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate on the financial statements as a whole. Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows: We set an overall Group materiality level of US$18.5 million (2019: US$19.6 million). This was based upon 5% of the Group\u2019s consolidated three-year average underlying profit before tax for the years ended 31st December 2018, 31st December 2019 and 31st December 2020. In arriving at this judgement we had regard to the fact that underlying profit is an important financial indicator of the Group. For each component in the scope of our Group audit, we allocated a materiality that is less than our overall Group materiality. The range of overall materiality allocated across components was US$1.9 million to US$18.0 million. Overall Group materiality How we determined it Rationale for benchmark applied 132 US$18.5 million (2019: US$19.6 million) 5% of a three-year average of underlying profit before tax Profit before tax is a primary measure used in assessing the performance of the Group which has been adjusted by adding back non-trading items.

            "text": "We use performance materiality to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements exceeds overall materiality. Specifically, we use performance materiality in determining the scope of our audit and the nature and extent of our testing of account balances, classes of transactions and disclosures, for example in determining sample sizes. Our performance materiality was 75% of overall materiality, amounting to US$13.8 million. In determining the performance materiality, we considered a number of factors \u2013 the history of misstatements, risk assessment and aggregation risk and the effectiveness of controls \u2013 and concluded that an amount in the middle of our normal range was appropriate. We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above US$925,000 (2019: US$1.0 million), other than classifications within the Consolidated Profit and Loss Account or Consolidated Balance Sheet, which were only reported above US$18.5 million. We also reported misstatements below this amount that in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons. Conclusions relating to going concern Our evaluation of the Directors\u2019 assessment of the Group\u2019s ability to continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting included: \u2022 Evaluating the inherent risks to the Group\u2019s and its businesses\u2019 business models and analysed how those risks might affect the Group\u2019s financial resources or ability to continue operations over the going concern period. \u2022 Considering sensitivities over the level of available financial resources indicated by the Group\u2019s financial forecasts taking account of reasonably possible, but not unrealistic, adverse effects that could arise from adverse trading conditions as a result of COVID-19 and impact the Group\u2019s liquidity position over the going concern period. Based on the work we have performed, we have not identified any material uncertainties relating to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least 12 months from when the financial statements are authorised for issue. In auditing the financial statements, we have concluded that the Directors\u2019 use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. Our responsibilities and the responsibilities of the Directors with respect to going concern are described in the relevant sections of this report. Reporting on other information The other information comprises all of the information in the Annual Report other than the financial statements and our auditors\u2019 report thereon. The Directors are responsible for the other information. Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and, accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion or any form of assurance thereon. In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If we identify an apparent material inconsistency or material misstatement, we are required to perform procedures to conclude whether there is a material misstatement of the financial statements or a material misstatement of the other information. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report based on these responsibilities. 133"

The Directors are also responsible for such internal control as they determine is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the financial statements, the Directors are responsible for assessing the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the Directors either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or have no realistic alternative but to do so. Auditors\u2019 responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors\u2019 report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs (UK) will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements. Our audit testing might include testing complete populations of certain transactions and balances, possibly using data auditing techniques. However, it typically involves selecting a limited number of items for testing, rather than testing complete populations. We will often seek to target particular items for testing based on their size or risk characteristics. In other cases, we will use audit sampling to enable us to draw a conclusion about the population from which the sample is selected.

The Group is committed to high standards of governance. The system of governance it has adopted has been developed over many years by the members of the Jardine Matheson group which both the Group and its stakeholders regard as appropriate to the nature of its business and the long-term strategy it pursues in its Asian markets, and is tailored to the Group\u2019s size, ownership structure, complexity and breadth of businesses. It enables the Company to benefit from Jardine Matheson\u2019s strategic guidance and professional expertise, while at the same time ensuring that the independence of the Board is respected and clear operational accountability rests with the Company\u2019s executive management teams. Having an effective corporate governance framework supports the Board in the delivery of the Group\u2019s strategy and supports long-term sustainable growth. Group Structure Jardine Matheson is the ultimate holding company of the Group. The structural relationship between Jardine Matheson group and the Group is considered to be a key element of the Group\u2019s success.

The Company\u2019s standard listing in London means that it is bound by many of the same rules as premium-listed companies under the UK Listing Rules, the DTRs, the Market Abuse Regulation\u00b9 (\u2018MAR\u2019) and the Prospectus Regulation Rules, including in relation to continuous disclosure, periodic financial reporting, disclosure of interests in shares, market abuse and the publication and content of prospectuses in connection with admission to trading or offering securities to the public. The Company is subject to regulatory oversight from the FCA, as the Company\u2019s principal securities regulator, and is required to comply with the Admission and Disclosure Standards of the Main Market of the LSE. The Company and its Directors are also subject to legislation and regulations in Singapore relating to insider dealing. The Company is not required to comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code (the \u2018Code\u2019), which applies to all premium-listed companies and sets out the governance principles and provisions which are expected to be followed by companies which are subject to the Code. When the shareholders approved the Company\u2019s move to a standard listing from a premium listing in 2014, the Company stated that it intended to maintain certain governance principles on the basis as was then applicable to the Company\u2019s premium listing. As a result, the Company has adopted a number of governance principles (the \u2018Governance Principles\u2019) based on the then applicable requirements for a premium listing, which go further than the standard listing requirements. The key elements of the Governance Principles are as follows: \u2022 When assessing a significant transaction (a larger transaction which would be classified as a class 1 transaction under the provisions of the UK Listing Rules), the Company will engage an independent financial adviser to provide a fairness opinion on the terms of the transaction. \u2022 If the Company carries out a related party transaction which would require a sponsor to provide a fair and reasonable opinion under the provisions of the UK Listing Rules, it will engage an independent financial adviser to confirm that the terms of the transaction are fair and reasonable as far as the shareholders of the Company are concerned. \u2022 Further, as soon as the terms of a significant transaction or a related party transaction are agreed, an announcement will be issued by the Company providing such details of the transaction as are necessary for investors to evaluate the effect of the transaction on the Company. \u2022 At each annual general meeting (\u2018AGM\u2018), the Company will seek shareholders\u2019 approval to issue new shares on a non-pre-emptive basis for up to 33% of the Company\u2019s issued share capital, of which up to 5% can be issued for cash consideration. \u2022 The Company adheres to a set of Securities Dealing Rules which follow the provisions of MAR with respect to market abuse and disclosure of interests in shares. 1 The EU Market Abuse Regulation and, with effect from 1st January 2021, the UK Market Abuse Regulation. 138 Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 2020"

            "text": "Corporate Governance Board Composition and Operational Management continued The Company has a dedicated executive management team led by the Group Chief Executive. The Memorandum of Association of the Company, however, provides for the chairman of Jardine Matheson to be, or to appoint, the Managing Director of the Company. Reflecting this, and the Jardine Matheson group\u2019s 78% interest in the Company\u2019s share capital, the Group Chief Executive and the Managing Director meet regularly. Similarly, the board of DFMS, and its finance committee are chaired by the Managing Director and include Dairy Farm Group executives as well as Jardine Matheson\u2019s deputy managing director, group finance director and group general counsel. The presence of Jardine Matheson representatives on the Board of the Company and on the board of DFMS, as well as on its audit and finance committees, provides an added element of stability to the Company\u2019s financial planning and supervision, enhancing its ability to raise finance and take a long-term view of business development. The presence of Jardine Matheson representatives on the Company\u2019s Board and nominations committee and DFMS\u2019 audit, finance and remuneration committees also strengthens the ability of management to work effectively together in exploiting the full range of the Jardine Matheson group\u2019s commercial strengths. As at 11th March 2021, the Company comprises 11 Directors, two of whom (18%) \u2013 Dr Delman Lee and Clive Schlee \u2013 are regarded as Independent Non-Executive Directors. Three further Non-Executive Directors \u2013 George J. Ho, Anthony Nightingale and Percy Weatherall \u2013 do not have any executive responsibilities, nor have they been an employee of the Company or the Group within the past five years, and they are sufficiently distanced from the day-to-day operations of the Company for the Company to take the view that they are independent Directors, even though they have served on the Board for over nine years. The names of all the Directors and brief biographies appear on pages 50 and 51 of this Report. Ben Keswick has been Chairman of the Board since 16th May 2013. John Witt has held the role of Managing Director from 15th June 2020. Ian McLeod has been Group Chief Executive since 18th September 2017. Ben Keswick previously held the roles of Chairman and Managing Director on a combined basis from 16th May 2013. The Board considers that there is a clear division of responsibilities among the Chairman, the Managing Director and the Group Chief Executive in order to ensure an appropriate balance of power and authority. Chairman The Chairman\u2019s role is to lead the Board, ensuring its effectiveness while taking account of the interests of the Group\u2019s various stakeholders, and promoting high standards of corporate governance. The Chairman\u2019s principal responsibilities are in the areas of strategy, relationships, governance and people. He leads the Board in overseeing the long-term strategic direction of the Group and approving its key business priorities. His key responsibilities also include: \u2022 Leading the development of the culture and values of the Group; \u2022 Supporting the development and maintenance of relationships with existing and new key business partners, governments and shareholders; \u2022 Ensuring (together with the Managing Director and the Group Chief Executive) an appropriate focus on attracting and retaining the right people and carrying out succession planning for senior management positions; \u2022 Creating a culture of openness and transparency at Board meetings; \u2022 Building an effective Board supported by a strong governance framework; \u2022 Ensuring all Directors effectively contribute to discussions and feel comfortable in engaging in healthy debate and constructive challenge; \u2022 Ensuring all Directors receive accurate, timely and clear information; and \u2022 Promoting effective communication between Executive and Non-Executive Directors. 140 Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 2020"

He has responsibility for representing Jardine Matheson, as the major shareholder in the Company, in its oversight of the day-to-day management by the Group Chief Executive and his leadership team of the businesses. Group Chief Executive The responsibility for running the Group\u2019s business and all the executive matters affecting the Group rests with the Group Chief Executive. The implementation of the Group\u2019s strategy is delegated to the Company\u2019s executive management, with decision-making authority within designated financial parameters delegated to the DFMS finance committee. The Group Chief Executive has day-to-day responsibility for: \u2022 The effective management of the Group\u2019s businesses; \u2022 Leading the development of the Company\u2019s strategic direction and implementing the agreed strategy; \u2022 Identifying and executing new business opportunities; \u2022 Managing the Group\u2019s risk profile and implementing and maintaining an effective framework of internal controls; \u2022 Developing targets and goals for his executive team; \u2022 Ensuring effective communication with shareholders and key stakeholders and regularly updating institutional investors on the business strategy and performance; \u2022 Providing regular operational updates to the Board on all matters of significance relating to the Group\u2019s business or reputation; \u2022 Overseeing the Group\u2019s capital allocation, business planning and performance; \u2022 Ensuring (together with the Chairman and the Managing Director) an appropriate focus on attracting and retaining the right people and carrying out succession planning for senior management positions; and \u2022 Fostering innovation and entrepreneurialism to drive the Group\u2019s businesses forward. Non-Executive Directors The Non-Executive Directors bring insight and experience to the Board. They have responsibility for constructively challenging the strategies proposed by the Executive Directors and scrutinising the performance of management in achieving agreed goals and objectives. Board Meetings The Board usually holds four meetings each year and ad hoc procedures are adopted to deal with urgent matters which arise between scheduled meetings. The majority of Board meetings are usually held in different locations around Asia and one Board meeting is usually held in Bermuda, at the same time as the Company\u2019s AGM each May. In 2020, due to travel restrictions imposed as a result of the pandemic, it was necessary to hold all four Board meetings virtually. The Board receives high quality, up to date information for each of its meetings, which is provided to Directors via a secure online board information portal. The Company\u2019s Directors who do not serve on the board of DFMS and who are based outside Asia will usually visit Asia and Bermuda to discuss the Group\u2019s businesses, as well as to participate in the four strategic reviews that precede the regular Board meetings. In 2020, all of these strategic reviews were held virtually as a result of the pandemic. These Directors are not directly involved in the operational management of the Group\u2019s business activities, but their knowledge of the Group\u2019s affairs, as well as their experience of the wider Jardine Matheson group, provide significant value to the ongoing review by the Company of the Group\u2019s businesses and reinforces the Board oversight process. 141"

The current members of the Nominations Committee are Ben Keswick, Adam Keswick and John Witt. The Nominations Committee meets at least annually and more often if necessary. It plays a key role in the process of recruiting senior executives. Candidates for appointment as Executive Directors of the Company or for other senior management positions may be sourced internally or externally, including by using the services of specialist executive search or recruitment firms. The aim is to appoint individuals who combine international business knowledge and experience, industry knowledge and experience if possible, and familiarity with, or adaptability to, Asian markets. When appointing Non-Executive Directors, the Committee pays particular attention to the Asian business experience and relationships that they can bring. 143"

Remuneration The Board has overall responsibility for setting remuneration across the Group, ensuring it is appropriate and supports the Group\u2019s strategy, creating value for stakeholders. The Remuneration Committee has been established to assist the Board in these remuneration matters. The Company\u2019s policy is to offer competitive remuneration packages to its senior executives. It is recognised that, due to the nature of the Group and its diverse geographic base, a number of its senior executives are required to be offered international terms and the nature of the remuneration packages is designed to reflect this. Executive Directors joining from outside the Group may be offered an initial fixed-term service contract to reflect any requirement for them to relocate. Directors\u2019 fees, which are payable to all Directors other than the Group Chief Executive and the Chief Financial Officer, are decided upon by shareholders in general meeting as provided for by the Company\u2019s Bye-laws. Remuneration in 2020 For the year ended 31st December 2020, the Directors received from the Group US$8.5 million (2019: US$8.5 million) in Directors\u2019 fees and employee benefits, being: \u2022 US$0.8 million (2019: US$0.8 million) in Directors\u2019 fees; and \u2022 US$6.4 million (2019: US$6.3 million) in short-term employee benefits including salary, bonuses, accommodation and deemed benefits in kind; \u2022 US$0.1 million (2019: US$0.1 million) in post-employment benefits; and \u2022 US$1.2 million (2019: US$1.3 million) in share-based payments.

Share options are granted by the scheme trustee after consultation between the Chairman and the Group Chief Executive as well as other Directors as they consider appropriate. Share options are not granted to Non-Executive Directors. In December 2018 a new cash-based long-term incentive plan was implemented for senior management, in order to align their remuneration with shareholders\u2019 interests by rewarding the delivery of strong EPS growth over the next five years. Payouts under the plan will also be dependent on the achievement of appropriate targets linked to the health of the business and the sustainability of earnings growth. Insurance and Indemnification The Company purchases insurance to cover its Directors against their costs in defending themselves in civil proceedings taken against them in that capacity and in respect of damages resulting from the unsuccessful defence of any proceedings. To the extent permitted by law, the Company also indemnifies its Directors. Neither insurance nor indemnity arrangements provide cover where the Director has acted fraudulently or dishonestly. Risk Management and Internal Control The Board has overall responsibility for the Group\u2019s systems of risk management and internal control. The Board has delegated to the Audit Committee responsibility for providing oversight in respect of risk management activities. The Audit Committee considers the Group\u2019s principal risks and uncertainties and potential changes to the risk profile and reviews the operation and effectiveness of the Group\u2019s systems of internal control (financial, operational and compliance) and the procedures by which these risks are monitored and mitigated. The Audit Committee considers the systems and procedures on a regular basis, and reports to the Board semi-annually. The systems of internal control are designed to manage, rather than eliminate, business risk; to help safeguard the Group\u2019s assets against fraud and other irregularities; and to give reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material financial misstatement or loss. Executive management is responsible for the implementation of the systems of internal control throughout the Group, and a series of audit committees at an operational level and the internal audit function monitor the effectiveness of the systems. The Group has an established risk management process which is reviewed on a regular basis and covers all business units within the Group. This includes the maintenance of risk registers which detail the emerging and existing risks to the future success of the business and the relevant key controls and mitigating factors which address those risks. These are reviewed on a regular basis. The internal audit function also monitors the approach taken by the business units to risk. The internal audit function is independent of the operating businesses and reports its findings, and recommendations for any corrective action required, to the Audit Committee. The principal risks and uncertainties facing the Company are set out on pages 149 and 150. 146 Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 2020"

There are established policies and procedures for financial planning and budgeting, information and reporting systems, assessment of risk; and monitoring the Group\u2019s operations and performance. The information systems in place are designed to ensure that the financial information reported is reliable and up to date. The Group\u2019s 50% associate, Maxim\u2019s Caterers Limited (\u2018MCL\u2019), has a separate board, audit committee, risk management and internal audit structure. The Group is represented on the board of MCL, at which reviews of strategy, operations, budgets and major investments are undertaken. The MCL board has delegated to the MCL group\u2019s audit and risk management committees and its audit department responsibility for reviewing areas of major risk and the effectiveness of the internal control procedures. Whistleblowing Policy The Group has a whistleblowing policy covering the process by which employees can report, in confidence, matters of serious concern. The Audit Committee has responsibility for overseeing the effectiveness of the formal procedures for employees to raise such matters and is required to review any reports made under those procedures which are referred to it by the internal audit function. Directors\u2019 Responsibilities in respect of the Financial Statements The Directors are required under the Companies Act to prepare financial statements for each financial year and to present them annually to the Company\u2019s shareholders at the AGM. The financial statements are required to present fairly, in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (\u2018IFRS\u2019), the financial position of the Group at the end of the year and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year then ended. The Directors consider that applicable accounting policies under IFRS, applied on a consistent basis and supported by prudent and reasonable judgements and estimates, have been followed in preparing the financial statements. The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. Code of Conduct The Group conducts business in a professional, ethical and even-handed manner. Its ethical standards are clearly set out in its Code of Conduct, which is a set of guidelines to which every employee must adhere and is reinforced and monitored by an annual compliance certification process, and is modelled on the Jardine Matheson group\u2019s code of conduct. The Code of Conduct requires that all Group companies comply with all laws of general application, all rules and regulations that are industry specific and proper standards of business conduct. The Code of Conduct prohibits the giving or receiving of illicit payments and requires that all managers must be fully aware of their obligations under the Code of Conduct and establish procedures to ensure compliance at all levels within their organisations. The Company\u2019s policy on commercial conduct underpins the Group\u2019s internal control process, particularly in the area of compliance. The policy is set out in the Group\u2019s Code of Conduct. Inclusion and Diversity The Code of Conduct also encourages inclusion and diversity, and requires all employees to be treated fairly, impartially and with dignity and respect. As a multinational Group with a broad range of businesses operating across Asia, the Group believes in promoting equal opportunities in recruiting, developing and rewarding its people regardless of race, gender, nationality, religion, sexual orientation, disability, age or background. The scale and breadth of the Group\u2019s businesses necessitate that they seek the best people from the communities in which they operate most suited to their needs. 147"

The programme links more than ten household brand names, including affiliate partners such as Hang Seng Bank and other businesses in the wider Jardine Matheson Group such as Pizza Hut and KFC, across over 2,000 locations in Hong Kong. For the first time, a CRM programme is allowing Dairy Farm to leverage the scale of all its banners in Hong Kong. The programme is both an important pillar supporting digital transformation within Dairy Farm and a means of maintaining Dairy Farm\u2019s strength in Hong Kong. 3) Revitalising Southeast Asia Profitability in the Group\u2019s Southeast Asian Grocery Retail business improved significantly in the year, due to a combination of the initiatives implemented as part of the Group\u2019s multi-year transformation programme and strong like-for-like sales growth. Despite delays caused by COVID-19 lockdown restrictions, the team successfully relaunched all Giant Singapore stores in 2020. This programme involved detailed research, combined with in-depth sales and merchandise analysis, a detailed plan to reapportion space, and investment in new equipment where required. All stores have now either been refreshed or refitted with a major brand facelift and space reallocation. There has also been a significant shift in emphasis onto Own Brand within Giant stores, and results have been encouraging. The repositioning of the Giant brand has been underpinned by a programme to re-establish price trust and to invest in lower prices on hundreds of frequently purchased items across fresh, grocery and chilled categories. Strong marketing execution was also implemented to support the brand repositioning. Whilst still early, these steps have led to an improved sales performance, with underlying like-for-like sales growing at their strongest rate since 2013. 12 Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 2020 Performance of our upscale Grocery Retail stores continues to show good progress. Improvements in range, availability and freshness are supporting improved sales performance. In addition, our new concept pilot stores, with much stronger emphasis on fresh food, international products, organic, health and wellness ranges, have performed very strongly. New concept stores have now been introduced in Malaysia and Singapore, in addition to those introduced in Hong Kong. Our Guardian Health and Beauty business remains a significant growth opportunity for the Group. However, like-for-like sales performance and profitability have been impacted by government restrictions on movement in each of the markets in which we operate. Despite the challenging environment, the team continues to focus on improving key areas of the business, including product range, value, store and sales channel development. Guardian Singapore relaunched its e-commerce platform in February, which supported around 40% growth in the year. In addition, new shop-in-shop concepts were executed in over 50 Giant stores in 2020. Guardian Malaysia reported triple-digit e-commerce growth in the year. Across our key geographies in Southeast Asia, localised versions of price reinvestment campaigns were also launched to enhance Guardian\u2019s customer offering. New health and beauty concept stores have also been developed and will be rolled out in a disciplined manner in 2021. Within Guardian Health and Beauty, growth in Own Brand is an area of focus, with the team working on a number of initiatives to create scale and differentiation. In 2020, one highlight in this area was the Group\u2019s new partnership with CP All to roll out Guardian products into around 12,000 7-Eleven stores across Thailand."

These interests include those notified to the Company in respect of the Directors\u2019 closely associated persons*. In addition, Ian McLeod held deferred share awards in respect of 398,343 ordinary shares issued pursuant to the Company\u2019s share-based long-term incentive plans. Substantial Shareholders As a non-UK issuer, the Company is subject to the provisions of the DTRs which require that a person must in certain circumstances notify the Company of the percentage of voting rights attaching to the share capital of the Company that person holds. The obligation to notify arises if that person acquires or disposes of shares in the Company which results in the percentage of voting rights which the person holds reaching, exceeding, or falling below, 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 50% and 75%. The Company has been informed of the holding of voting rights of 5% or more attaching to the Company\u2019s issued ordinary share capital by Jardine Strategic Holdings Limited (\u2018Jardine Strategic\u2019), which is directly interested in 1,049,589,171 ordinary shares carrying 77.58% of the voting rights. By virtue of its interest in Jardine Strategic, Jardine Matheson is also interested in the same ordinary shares. Apart from this shareholding, the Company is not aware of any holders of voting rights of 5% or more attaching to the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 11th March 2021. There were no contracts of significance with corporate substantial shareholders during the year under review. Related Party Transactions Details of transactions with related parties entered into by the Company during the course of the year are included in note 33 to the financial statements on page 99. Securities Purchase Arrangements The Directors have the power under the Companies Act and the Company\u2019s Memorandum of Association to purchase the Company\u2019s shares. Any shares so purchased shall be treated as cancelled and, therefore, reduce the issued share capital of the Company. When the Board reviews the possibility for share repurchases, it will take into consideration the potential for the enhancement of earnings or asset values per share. When purchasing such shares, the Company is subject to the provisions of MAR. Annual General Meeting The 2021 AGM will be held on 5th May 2021.

            "text": "Principal Risks and Uncertainties The Board has overall responsibility for risk management and internal control. The process by which the Group identifies and manages risk is set out in more detail on page 146 of the Corporate Governance section of this Report. The following are the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Company as required to be disclosed pursuant to the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules issued by the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom and are in addition to the matters referred to in the Chairman\u2019s Statement, the Group Chief Executive\u2019s Review and other parts of the Annual Report. Economic Risk Most of the Group\u2019s businesses are exposed to the risk of negative developments in global and regional economies and financial markets, either directly or through the impact such developments might have on the Group\u2019s joint venture partners, associates, franchisors, bankers, suppliers or customers. These developments could include recession, inflation, deflation, currency fluctuations, restrictions in the availability of credit, business failures, or increases in financing costs, oil prices, the cost of raw materials or finished products. Such developments might increase operating costs, reduce revenues, lower asset values or result in some or all of the Group\u2019s businesses being unable to meet their strategic objectives. Commercial Risk and Financial Risk Risks are an integral part of normal commercial activities, and where practicable steps are taken to mitigate them. Risks can be more pronounced when businesses are operating in volatile markets. While the Group\u2019s regional diversification does help to mitigate some risks, a significant portion of the Group revenues and profits continue to be derived from our operations in Hong Kong. A number of the Group\u2019s businesses make significant investment decisions in respect of developments or projects and these are subject to market risks. This is especially the case where projects are longer-term in nature and take more time to deliver returns. The Group\u2019s businesses operate in areas that are highly competitive, and failure to compete effectively, whether in terms of price, product specification, technology, property site or levels of service or to adapt to changing consumer behaviours, including new shopping channels and formats, can have an adverse effect on earnings. Significant competitive pressure may also lead to reduced margins. It is essential for the products and services provided by the Group\u2019s businesses to meet appropriate quality and safety standards and there is an associated risk if they do not, including the risk of damage to brand equity or reputation, which might adversely impact the ability to achieve acceptable revenues and profit margins. While social media presents significant opportunities for the Group\u2019s businesses to connect with customers and the public, it also creates a whole new set of potential risks for companies to monitor, including damage to brand equity or reputation, which could affect the Group\u2019s profitability. The steps taken by the Group to manage its exposure to financial risk are set out in the Financial Review on page 49 and note 38 to the financial statements on pages 112 to 119. Concessions, Franchises and Key Contracts A number of the Group\u2019s businesses and projects are reliant on concessions, franchises, management or other key contracts. Cancellation, expiry or termination, or the renegotiation of any such concessions, franchises, management or other key contracts, could have an adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of certain subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures of the Group. 149"

            "text": "Principal Risks and Uncertainties Regulatory and Political Risk The Group\u2019s businesses are subject to a number of regulatory regimes in the territories in which they operate. Changes in such regimes, in relation to matters such as foreign ownership of assets and businesses, exchange controls, licensing, imports, planning controls, emission regulations, tax rules and employment legislation, could have the potential to impact the operations and profitability of the Group\u2019s businesses. Changes in the political environment, including political or social unrest, in the territories where the Group operates could adversely affect the Group\u2019s businesses. Terrorism, Pandemic and Natural Disasters The Group\u2019s operations are vulnerable to the effects of terrorism, either directly through the impact of an act of terrorism or indirectly through the effect on the Group\u2019s businesses of generally reduced economic activity in response to the threat, or an actual act, of terrorism. The Group\u2019s businesses could be impacted by a global or regional pandemic which seriously affects economic activity or the ability of businesses to operate smoothly. In addition, many of the territories in which the Group operates can experience from time to time natural disasters such as earthquakes, volcanoes and typhoons. Technology Risk The Group has invested significantly in and is heavily reliant on its IT infrastructure and systems for the daily operation of its business. Any major disruption to the Group\u2019s IT systems could have a significant impact on operations. The ability to anticipate and adapt to technology advancements or threats is an additional risk that may also have an impact on the business. Cybersecurity Risk The Group faces increasing numbers of cyberattacks from groups targeting both individuals and businesses. The privacy and security of customer and corporate information is at risk of being compromised through a breach of our or our suppliers\u2019 IT systems or the unauthorised or inadvertent release of information, resulting in brand damage, impaired competitiveness or regulatory action. Cyberattacks may also adversely affect our ability to manage our business operations, or operate information technology and business systems, resulting in business interruption, lost revenues, repair or other costs. 150 Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 2020"

            "text": "Robinsons Retail continued to successfully integrate Rustan Supercenters in 2020. However, its financial performance was impacted by restrictions on movement caused by COVID-19, particularly with respect to its discretionary retail businesses. In October, Dairy Farm deepened its partnership with Robinsons Retail by combining its interests in Rose Pharmacy with Robinsons Retail\u2019s subsidiary Southstar Drug. The combination creates a leading pharmacy chain in the Philippines. The combined business will support greater competitiveness, create synergies and allow both Dairy Farm and Robinsons Retail to leverage scale. 4) Building capability The Group has balanced internal promotions with the introduction of external capability, and the change in leadership within the organisation has brought depth of experience and thinking to Dairy Farm. It has also led to a cultural shift within the Group in terms of our ways of working. In turn, this has supported the resilience of the business and our ability to adapt to rapidly evolving challenges posed by the pandemic, including different and changing approaches by governments in each of the regions in which we operate. Decisive action was taken to ensure joint co-ordination of: resourcing to support fluctuations in trading hours; inventory procurement to ensure stability of supply; supply of health and hygiene products for all team members; and clear, regular, consistent communications updates to all team members. One outcome of strong execution in this area has been that Dairy Farm has been at the forefront of ensuring our people\u2019s safety. As we move to the next phase of our transformation, we are seeking to nurture talent from within through the development of our own graduate recruitment programmes and through close co-operation with the wider Jardine Matheson Group. Our focus on building capability has not been limited to management positions above store level. We have also invested in our systems and processes to enhance our team members\u2019 skills on the shop floor in an agile manner. In 2020, we rolled out a new software system to train team members through mobile devices, which enables easy access to training on the shop floor and on the job. Now accessible to over 50,000 team members across the Group, the system also enabled the training of 22,000 team members within three weeks to support the successful and smooth rollout of the Yuu Rewards programme. 5) Driving digital innovation Dairy Farm is accelerating the pace of its digital change to adapt to the rapidly changing environment. The Yuu Rewards programme launched in July has been highly successful and total membership has now reached over three million. In 2020, the Yuu Rewards app was the most downloaded app on the Apple appstore in Hong Kong. Over 50 billion points have been earned, highlighting a high level of member engagement. We believe this is just the beginning, and we are excited to begin a deeper and more meaningful dialogue with our customers. It has been well documented that the spread of the pandemic has led to a global surge in e-commerce growth. Strong online sales growth has supported our Home Furnishings business, with e-commerce penetration over 10% in 2020. We have also invested in infrastructure supporting e-commerce for Health and Beauty in Mannings businesses in both Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland, as well as cross-border e-commerce and Guardian in Southeast Asia. An all-new Marketplace app was also launched in 2020, with enhanced service capability to support fulfilment. E-commerce has been an area where Dairy Farm has historically lagged. However, the Group is now treating this area as a strategic priority. 13"

Resource scarcity, coupled with climate change, will have a devastating environmental and socio-economic impact. It is clear that urgent global action is needed to safeguard our environment. Mandarin Oriental complies with environmental laws and regulations, setting goals and monitoring our progress toward energy, carbon, water and waste reduction, as well as responsible procurement. Since 2012, we have been driving internal changes, adopting industry best practices, and embracing innovation to enhance operational efficiency. We currently utilise a dedicated online sustainability data management system to streamline our data collection and monitor progress in real-time. In 2019, we reported a significant reduction of approximately one fifth of our environmental footprint intensities when compared to our baseline years. 1 Energy intensity reduction per square metre from 2007 baseline 2 Carbon intensity reduction per square metre from 2007 baseline 19.6% Mandarin Oriental HOtel GrOup 2020 Environmental targets ENERGY intenSity Reduction1 Goal: 20% caRbon intenSity Reduction2 Goal: 25% 27% SuStainability repOrt 2020 3 Water intensity reduction per square metre from 2007 baseline 4 Waste intensity reduction per guest night from 2012 baseline WATER intenSity Reduction3 Goal: 20% 16.4% WASTE intenSity Reduction4 Goal: 25% 21.3% This year completes our 2020 Environmental Targets established in 2012.

Factoring in 2020\u2019s performance figures would overstate the efficiency reductions the Group has achieved through our efforts, thus they are excluded in the evaluation of our overall performance against 2020 Environmental Targets. Nonetheless, we are disclosing our 2020 performance figures in Appendix A for transparency in communicating our environmental footprint. We are encouraged by the success we have achieved and next year, we will continue to advance our environmental efforts with a new set of bold goals. 14"

Recognising the hardship faced by all members of the community during these challenging times, we responded by providing increased support to the communities that we serve. Some examples include Wellcome\u2019s significant \u2018Give Back\u2019 programme which involves the distribution of over two million cash and meal vouchers to the most in need groups in Hong Kong; Mannings\u2019 partnership with the Hong Kong Hospital Authority to provide medication collection services to local residents to reduce the risk of infection from hospital visits; and company matching of Yuu Rewards points donated by customers. In addition, we have introduced price investment programmes across our banners and geographies to drive value for customers. In total, the Group has made over US$50 million of direct investments in supporting the health, safety and well-being of our team members as well as in supporting our communities as a result of COVID-19 in 2020. The Group will continue to invest to support our team members and community given the gravity of the impact of the pandemic. I would also like to express my deep gratitude for the continuing dedication and resolve of team members in putting customers first during these difficult times. Year ahead Undoubtedly, 2020 was a challenging year. The extent and duration of the impact of the pandemic in 2021 remains unclear, and this year is likely to remain challenging. Despite the short-term impact from the pandemic, however, our team members remain motivated, determined and resolute in the continued execution of the Dairy Farm multi-year transformation plan. We are halfway through that plan and there is much still to do. Despite all adverse external influences, the transformation plan remains on track. While financial results do not yet reflect the efforts made to date, we are confident that the actions being taken remain the right ones and the Company is in a far better shape now to face the challenges of the market going forward. I would like to thank my Leadership Team, their teams and every team member in our stores who have worked tirelessly for Dairy Farm over the last three years to get us this far. Our store teams do deserve a special mention. In every country where lockdowns were put in place and populations were encouraged and even mandated to stay home for their safety, our store and supply chain teams turned up to do their jobs in genuinely dangerous circumstances. I could not be more grateful for their support. Ian McLeod Group Chief Executive 11th March 2021 15"

We are also aware that as a large company operating in many countries, we have a responsibility to recognise the increasing needs of the communities we serve and look for ways in which we can make contributions to help them. We want to help both our customers and our team members (People), we want to help improve our supply chain by reducing food waste, lowering plastic usage and sourcing ethically (Products). We want to improve energy efficiency, recognising growing concerns over climate change (Planet) and we wish to strengthen partnerships with like-minded organisations who also wish to make a sustainable difference. We would be the first to accept that all organisations can do more in the area of corporate and social responsibility, and we are no exception. We are building greater focus on where we can begin to make a difference and demonstrate measured progress over time. Below are some examples of the early progress we believe we are making: People Helping customers, their communities and our team members We are greatly appreciative of the service our team members provide to our customers on the front-line day in and day out, therefore making them feel safe is our number one priority. We have invested heavily in providing over 440,000 pieces of personal protective equipment (masks, hand sanitisers and goggles) for our team members to ensure they are protected and feel safe when serving customers amidst the pandemic. In a year like no other, we prioritised helping our communities. We were the first retailer in Hong Kong, Malaysia and Indonesia to implement priority shopping hours in our supermarkets for the most vulnerable members of our communities, ensuring they can shop safely, secure in the knowledge that we are putting their health and wellbeing first. Mannings Hong Kong was 16 Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 2020 also the first Hong Kong retailer to take on a community pharmacy role. We launched a medication collection service in our Mannings stores, thereby reducing hospital footfall and the associated risk of infection. With demand increasing significantly at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, we needed to quickly bring additional help onboard to better serve our customers. Based on these needs, we saw an opportunity in Singapore to support other affected industries by offering recruitment opportunities to their teams. We first started the initiative with Fairmont Singapore, then the Food Drinks Allied Workers\u2019 Union (FDAWU) came onboard in support of our efforts and expanded the outreach to more hotel partners, such as the Four Seasons and other international hotel chains. Through this initiative, we provided support to those in the tourism and hospitality industry who have been impacted by COVID-19. We also donated care packs to those in need within our communities. We place huge significance on access to education for all, which meant stepping up when the pandemic forced school closures in Indonesia. Hero Group partnered with Human Initiative to launch online learning centres, equipping underprivileged students with smartphones, computer laptops and free internet access so they can thrive academically without obstacles."

Products Sourcing more sustainable choices for our customers We are determined to allow customers to make sustainable choices, and we have been leveraging our partnerships to source products that treat animals in a humane and dignified manner. Part of our \u2018Products\u2019 focus is paying attention to animal welfare and we have been working closely with Humane Society International (HSI) to make a change. Together with HSI, we are working to drive long-term change in the supply chain. As part of this, we will be launching a new value range of cage-free eggs under our Meadows Brand in Hong Kong and Singapore in 2021, whilst introducing cage-free eggs into all ten of our IKEA restaurants in 2021 in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Our IKEA meatballs are enjoyed around the world, and we listened to our customers to provide them with a more sustainable version of a well-loved classic. Launched in October 2020, the IKEA \u2018Plant Balls\u2019 still deliver the great taste and texture of the IKEA meatballs whilst being responsible for just 4% of its predecessors climate footprint. In this way, we are proud to continue innovating in this field and giving our customers the choice to make more environmentally friendly decisions. We do not just focus on life on land. We look to source seafood sustainably, making a concerted effort to protect threatened species and promote products which are MSC, ASC and BAP certified. Our customers also rely on us to provide them with fresh and high-quality products, and we want to ensure Meat-free IKEA \u2018Plant Balls\u2019 \u2013 a more sustainable choice. we provide that constantly. Our \u2018Fresher for Customers\u2019 programme improves the shopping experience for our customers by managing inventory better to improve freshness and at the same time minimise waste. Through this programme, we have reduced food waste by nearly 10,000 tonnes in the last two years across our markets. Donating food offers a further opportunity to minimise food waste in our stores, whilst having a positive effect on the welfare of those in need within our communities. For example in Malaysia, Giant collaborated with The Lost Food Project to ensure food is not wasted but delivered to those who need it most. In total, the partnership saw RM50,000 worth of food supplies donated through 26 charity organisations across Klang Valley and Negeri Sembilan. PT Hero partnered with Taman Safari Indonesia to donate fresh produce to animals in conservation. With COVID-19 putting an intense strain on business for zoos and aquariums, this partnership demonstrates a forward-thinking scheme to meet two distinct needs with one fantastic solution. In Singapore, the installation of a food waste management machine, known as an ecoDigester, enables the conversion of organic waste into water for washing. In Hong Kong, our collaboration with O \u00b7 Park allows us to divert organic waste for conversion into biogas and compost. Moreover, Giant are currently trialling a new composting method with our NGO partner in Indonesia, where larvae decompose food waste into organic fertiliser. We endeavour to roll out similar sustainable technologies in other markets and work towards developing a circular economy within our operations. 17"

In Hong Kong, alongside our involvement with the Drink Without Waste initiative, we installed Reverse Vending Machines in our stores to kick off our pilot programme. In six months, our machines saved over 50,000 plastic bottles from going to landfill. This ensures that more plastic bottles are recycled properly whilst making it easier for the public to participate in environmentally friendly practices. In other plastic reduction efforts, we have reviewed tray thickness in our Hong Kong Fresh Food Centre, reducing plastic usage by 14% without compromising on food hygiene. We have sought to reduce plastic usage in stores, resulting in a 24% reduction from the previous year.

Our eco-friendly IKEA Taoyuan store opened last year has many sustainable installations, including LOW-E insulating glass windows for reducing energy consumption associated with air conditioning. The building also features a total of 802 solar panels on its roof, supplying energy equivalent to the amount used by nearly 70 households per year. Similarly, the IKEA Qingpu store was awarded the \u2018Taiwan EEWH Green Building Gold Certificate\u2019 due to the installation of 802 EV panels and 4 wind turbines on its roof. Thanks to these additions, the building generates 10% of its total electricity usage in renewable energy. Over the past year, we have instigated encouraging reductions in our energy consumption. For example, we have introduced energy awareness campaigns in our stores and installed speed doors in our Fresh Food Centre to improve temperature control. Overall, we reduced our energy consumption in Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia by 16 million kWh, equal to reducing our CO 2 emissions by over 8 million kg."

Today we lead the industry in Asia, offering the freshest produce, excellent service and great value through a range of iconic brands. Total Grocery Retail sales increased by 3% to US$5.3 billion. This performance was driven by strong double-digit like-for-like sales growth, partially offset by the annualisation impact of the Group\u2019s space optimisation programme, which was executed in 2019. The strong like-for-like sales performance was driven by a combination of a shift in customer behaviour towards eating-at-home and operational improvements to our range, quality and pricing. Operating profit increased from US$63 million to US$267 million, primarily driven by strong sales performance and cost benefits from our improvement programmes. Sales in Hong Kong and Macau were significantly ahead of the prior year, with strong double-digit like-for-like sales growth. Reported profitability was supported by strong sales growth, the ongoing execution of improvement programmes as well as government subsidies. Our price reinvestment campaign in Taiwan, as well as changing customer behaviours, supported strong sales growth for Wellcome Taiwan. During the year, the Group announced that it had entered into an agreement with Carrefour for them to acquire 100% of Wellcome Taiwan.

During 2020, we opened one new store in Macau during the height of the pandemic, as well as a new larger replacement store in Taiwan, with performance for both stores encouraging.

Strong growth in operating profit for Grocery Retail and IKEA was offset by a reduction in profit for the Health and Beauty and Convenience businesses. Among the Group\u2019s subsidiaries, disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has had the greatest impact on our Health and Beauty and Convenience businesses. Significant sales and profit growth was seen in the Grocery Retail business, driven by changing customer behaviours in response to the pandemic. There was strong profit growth across North Asia and Southeast Asia, driven by benefits accrued from implementing improvement programmes, strong sales and government subsidies. Performance in Indonesia, however, was impacted negatively by government restrictions on movement, which affected traffic into hypermarkets. Home Furnishings traded strongly, benefitting from strong e-commerce growth and an increase in the store network, which offset the pandemic-related disruption. Performance for the Health and Beauty business was impacted adversely by COVID-19 due to a lack of tourist travel, reduced footfall in shopping malls and temporary store closures because of government measures to counter the pandemic. In North Asia, enforced border closures have led to impacted tourism, which has impacted our Mannings business significantly. Government imposed restrictions on movement and reduction in foot traffic impacted performance for the Convenience business. Net financing charges decreased by US$16 million compared with 2019, in part reflecting a reduced borrowing level and lower interest rates. The Group\u2019s share of the results of associates and joint ventures decreased by 33% to US$85 million compared with 2019, principally due to a significantly lower contribution from Maxim\u2019s, as the pandemic, government-imposed restrictions on movement and social distancing measures caused a substantial reduction to customer visits to restaurants, as well as leading to some temporary closures.

The unfavourable movement in working capital in the year was due principally to investments to maintain availability during the early part of the pandemic, inventory stockpiling as a result of government policies in Singapore, settlement of supplier purchase obligations with respect to an earlier 2020 Chinese New Year as well as lower sales churn in the Health and Beauty business. Normal capital expenditure was lower at US$248 million versus US$305 million in 2019 due principally to tighter control on new store expansions and refurbishment of the existing store estate. The tax payment was higher at US$110 million versus US$25 million in 2019 due to a delay in the timing of the 2019 Hong Kong tax payment to 2020. During the year, the Group deepened its strategic partnership with Robinsons Retail, by combining its interest in the wholly-owned subsidiary, Rose Pharmacy, through a sale to Robinsons Retail\u2019s subsidiary, South Star Drug, for cash proceeds of US$84 million. In addition, the Group divested its 100% interest in Wellcome Taiwan to Carrefour for US$109 million and invested US$15 million in a newly established digital joint venture to support its e-commerce development and drive digital innovation. 6% 2020 Normal Capital Expenditure: Grocery Retail Convenience Stores Health and Beauty 50 % US$248 million 24% 12 % 8% Home Furnishings Store Support Centre"

Included in this total are 1,371 Yonghui stores, 1,741 Maxim\u2019s stores and 1,853 Robinsons Retail stores. Balance sheet Total assets, excluding cash and bank balances, of US$7.6 billion were broadly in line with 2019. Inventory was down by 13% to US$779 million, reflecting the continuous effort to manage inventory and clear poor-quality stocks. Net operating assets were US$1.3 billion at the end of 2020, an 8% increase versus the previous year. The Group ended the year with net debt of US$817 million, broadly in line with last year\u2019s level. Dividend The Board is recommending a final dividend of US\u00a211.50 per share, giving a total dividend of US\u00a216.50 per share for the year, a 21% reduction compared with 2019. Financing The Group, excluding associates and joint ventures, had gross debt of US$1,094 million at 31st December 2020, a drop of US$28 million from 2019. The gross debt is funded by total committed and uncommitted lines of US$3,091 million. At the end of 2020, US$1,319 million of committed and US$676 million of uncommitted facilities were unused and available. The Group had cash balances of US$278 million at 31st December 2020. The Group has implemented a global liquidity cash pooling scheme which enables the Group to manage and optimise its working capital funding requirements daily. The available undrawn committed facilities and the cash pooling scheme provide good support and flexibility to the Group for the cash in need for the operation. The Directors believe that the Group has strong liquidity to run the business during the pandemic and beyond. Where required, and typically for working capital purposes, borrowings are normally taken out in local currencies by the Group\u2019s operating subsidiaries to fund daily operations. Borrowings to fund any strategic expansion of the Group are managed centrally and typically funded in United States dollars and Hong Kong dollars, with hedging of foreign exchange and interest rate risk as may be appropriate depending on the investment. Financial risk management A comprehensive discussion of the Group\u2019s financial risk management policies is included in note 38 to the financial statements. The Group manages its exposure to financial risk using a variety of techniques and instruments. The main objectives are to limit exchange and interest rate risks and to provide a degree of certainty about costs. It is our policy not to engage in speculative derivative transactions. The investment of the Group\u2019s cash resources is managed to minimise risk while seeking to enhance yield. Overall, the Group\u2019s funding arrangements are designed to keep an appropriate balance between equity and debt (short and long-term), to maximise flexibility for the future development of the business. Principal risks and uncertainties A review of the principal risks and uncertainties facing the Group is set out on pages 149 to 150. Clem Constantine Chief Financial Officer 11th March 2021 49"

Having considered the impact arising from COVID-19 pandemic and the current economic environment on the Group\u2019s performance and cash flows, the Directors believe that the Group has strong liquidity to run the business during the pandemic and beyond and accordingly, the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost convention except as disclosed in the accounting policies. Details of the Group\u2019s principal accounting policies are included in note 36. The Group has elected to early adopt the \u2018Interest Rate Benchmark Reform \u2013 Phase 1: Amendments to IFRS 9, IAS 39 and IFRS 7\u2019 (effective 1st January 2020) in relation to hedge accounting for the Group\u2019s annual reporting period commencing 1st January 2019. The Group has adopted the following changes in relation to rent concessions for the annual reporting period commencing 1st January 2020. COVID-19 Related Rent Concessions: Amendment to IFRS 16 Leases The Group has early adopted the Amendment, which is effective 1st June 2020. Where the Group is a lessee, the practical expedient is applied to account for the change in lease payments resulting from rent concessions granted as a direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and elects not to assess these concessions as lease modifications when all of the following conditions are met: (i) the revised lease payments are substantially the same as, or less than, the consideration for the lease immediately preceding the change; (ii) reduction in lease payments relates to payment due on or before 30th June 2021; and (iii) there is no substantive change to the other terms and conditions of the lease. Rent concessions fulfilling the above conditions are recognised in the profit and loss over the period in which they cover. Apart from the above, there are no other amendments which are effective in 2020 and relevant to the Group\u2019s operations, that have a significant impact on the Group\u2019s results, financial position and accounting policies. The Group has not early adopted any other standards, interpretations or amendments that have been issued but not yet effective (note 37).

The table below analyses the carrying value of goodwill by groups of CGU. Management has assessed the recoverable amount of each CGU based on value-in-use calculations using cash flow projections based on approved budgets and projections based on the weighted average of remaining lease terms ranging from five to 15 years. Following the impairment review, goodwill relating to PT Hero amounted US$38.6 million was fully impaired and charged to the profit and loss during the year. In 2019, goodwill arising from the acquisition of the remaining 70% shareholding in Jutaria amounted to US$4.4 million (note 29(d)) was fully impaired after the impairment review. During the year, the Group disposed of its 100% interest in Rose Pharmacy to a subsidiary of Robinsons Retail (note 29(f)). Key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations for the significant balances of goodwill in 2020 include budgeted gross margins between 22% and 26% (2019: 18% and 31%) and average sales growth rates are between 1.0% and 5.0% (2019: 1.0% and 2.7%) to project cash flows, which vary across the Group\u2019s business segments and geographical locations, over the weighted average of remaining lease terms, and are based on management expectations for the market development; and pre-tax discount rates of between 5% and 12% (2019: 5% and 14%) applied to the cash flow projections. The discount rates used reflect business specific risks relating to the relevant industry, business life-cycle and geographical location.

Pension Plans The Group operates defined benefit pension plans in Hong Kong, Indonesia, Taiwan and the Philippines, with the major plan in Hong Kong. These plans are final salary defined benefits, calculated based on members\u2019 lengths of service and their salaries in the final years leading up to retirement. All pension benefits are paid in one lump sum. With the exception of certain plans, all the defined benefit plans are closed to new members. In addition, all plans are impacted by discount rate while liabilities are driven by salary growth. The Group\u2019s defined benefit plans are both funded and unfunded, with the assets of the funded plans held independently of the Group\u2019s assets in separate trustee administered funds. Plan assets held in trusts are governed by local regulations and practices in each country. Responsibility for governance of the plans, including investment decisions and contribution schedules, lies jointly with the company and the boards of trustees. The Group\u2019s major plans are valued by independent actuaries annually using the projected unit credit method. 86 Dairy Farm International Holdings Limited Annual Report 2020 The amounts recognised in the consolidated balance sheet are as follows: Fair value of plan assets Present value of funded obligations Present value of unfunded obligations Net pension liabilities Analysis of net pension liabilities: Pension assets Pension liabilities 2020 US$m 187.9 (194.7) (6.8) (6.6) (13.4) \u2013 (13.4) (13.4) 2019 US$m 183.2 (208.0) (24.8) (6.5) (31.3) \u2013 (31.3) (31.3)"

Continued progress in implementing the Group\u2019s transformation programme, however, helped the business adapt to the rapidly changing environment, while the diversity of the Group\u2019s businesses, coupled with the impact of ongoing efficiency improvement programmes, supported the Group\u2019s overall financial performance. A number of key initiatives gathered momentum in the year and the Group is now more effectively leveraging scale and developing an improved customer proposition across all banners and markets. Operating performance Sales of US$10.3 billion for the year by the Group\u2019s subsidiaries were 8% behind those of 2019. Total sales, including 100% of associates and joint ventures, were 2% higher at US$28.2 billion, primarily due to a higher sales contribution from Yonghui. The Group\u2019s subsidiaries saw underlying operating profit of US$412 million, 6% behind the previous year. Strong growth in operating profit for Grocery Retail and IKEA was offset by a reduction in profit for the Health and Beauty and Convenience businesses. Among the Group\u2019s subsidiaries, disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic has had the greatest impact on our Health and Beauty business in Hong Kong. Underlying profit attributable to shareholders was US$276 million, down 14% from US$321 million last year. Underlying earnings per share of US\u00a220.38 were also down 14%."

Awards normally vest on or after the third anniversary of the date of grant and may be subject to the achievement of performance conditions. An LTIP was adopted by the Company on 5th March 2015. Under these awards, free shares are received by the participants to the extent the award vests. Conditions, if any, are at the discretion of the Directors. There were no share awards granted in 2020 and 2019. Prior to the adoption of the LTIP, The Dairy Farm International Share Option Plan 2005 provided selected executives with options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company. The exercise prices of the granted options were, in general, based on the average market prices for the five trading days immediately preceding the dates of grant of the options. Options are normally vested over a period of up to three years and are exercisable for up to ten years following the date of grant. The fair value of options granted during the year, determined using the trinomial valuation model, was US$0.1 million. The significant inputs into the model, based on the number of options issued, were share price of US$4.46 at the grant date, exercise price of US$5.93, expected volatility based on the last five years of 24.21%, dividend yield of 4.33%, option life of six years, and annual risk-free interest rate of 0.35%.

This scheme is aimed at investing in new people capabilities as well as retaining high potential individuals for stronger succession planning. The scheme has been designed to appropriately compensate, attract and retain experienced senior management. The scheme will be predominantly measured based on compound growth in underlying earnings per share. To ensure that the growth is delivered appropriately, another measure based on health of business (focused on areas such as quality of earnings and balance sheet strength) is also incorporated.

The Board is recommending a final dividend of US\u00a211.50 per share, giving a total dividend of US\u00a216.50 per share for the year, a 21% reduction compared to 2019. Food \u2013 Grocery Retail Total Grocery Retail sales increased by 3% to US$5.3 billion. Strong like-for-like sales growth across both North Asia and Southeast Asia was partially offset by the annualisation impact of the Group\u2019s space optimisation programme, which was executed in 2019. Operating profit for the Group\u2019s Grocery Retail business increased significantly from US$63 million in 2019 to US$267 million in 2020, demonstrating the benefit of a diversified retail portfolio. There was strong profit growth across both North Asia and Southeast Asia, driven by benefits accrued from implementing improvement programmes, strong like-for-like sales and government subsidies. Performance in Indonesia, however, was negatively impacted by significant government restrictions on movement, which affected traffic into hypermarkets. * Including share of associates and joint ventures. \u2020 Based on operating profit before effect of adopting IFRS 16 and share of results of associates and joint ventures, excluding selling, general and administrative expenses and non-trading items.
