            "text": "Approach to tax Our tax principles and tax code of conduct are integral to our responsible approach to tax and our effective interaction with tax authorities. Our tax principles and tax code of conduct Overview Our tax principles We have set out and published clear tax principles that govern our approach to tax planning. Our tax planning must: \u25a0 support genuine commercial activity \u25a0 comply with generally accepted custom and practice, in addition to the law and the UK Code of Practice on Taxation for Banks \u25a0 be of a type that the tax authorities would expect \u25a0 only take place with customers and clients sophisticated enough to assess its risks \u25a0 be consistent with, and be seen to be consistent with, our purpose and values. Our tax principles are central to our approach to tax planning for ourselves or on behalf of our clients. 09 Barclays PLC home.barclays/annualreport Our tax code of conduct and \u2018no surprises\u2019 approach Our tax department comprises in-house professionals from a combination of tax, legal and accounting backgrounds. The majority of our tax team is based in London and New York. We also have tax professionals based in other key jurisdictions. Our tax professionals are subject to clear standards including that they uphold our tax principles and follow our tax code of conduct. The tax department works closely with the businesses and other functions such as Human Resources and Finance, ensuring that our approach to tax is consistently applied throughout the organisation. Our tax code of conduct is an integral part of how we operate: \u25a0 all tax planning is subject to a robust review and approval process \u25a0 our approach to taxation is clearly explained and publicly available, and our tax reporting is transparent and helpful to stakeholders \u25a0 our dealings with tax authorities are handled proactively, constructively and transparently, recognising that early resolution of our tax affairs is in everyone\u2019s interest, and we respond to feedback from tax authorities \u25a0 any litigation necessary to resolve a difference of opinion will be handled in a way that is consistent with our values. Tax contribution Artwork Approach to tax We seek to comply with the spirit as well as the letter of the law and we take account of established practice in the territories in which we operate. We are transparent in both the disclosure of our tax affairs to tax authorities as well as our tax reporting to other stakeholders. When we have a new product or transaction, we check that the tax treatment is well-understood and the tax obligations are properly managed. Where necessary, we consult with external advisers to help us manage our tax position and ensure that we are making appropriate decisions. We also consult with external advisers to help us understand the implications of new or proposed tax law. Our aim is to take a \u2018no surprises\u2019 approach to our interactions with tax authorities by demonstrating the following behaviours in our dealings with them: \u25a0 we aim to have professional and constructive relationships with tax authorities \u25a0 we aim to make our tax returns as clear as possible and we try to raise important issues proactively and in real time so that tax authorities can focus their resources effectively \u25a0 we aim to be co-operative and helpful when dealing with enquiries raised by tax authorities \u25a0 from time to time, if it is unclear how tax law should be applied, we may engage with tax authorities to confirm the correct application of tax law. Since their introduction in 2013, we believe our tax principles and our tax code of conduct have been very valuable additions to the way we manage tax, allowing us to balance the needs of all of our stakeholders when making decisions related to our tax affairs.

            "text": "Approach to tax Here we explore how our approach applies to our clients and our businesses. Our clients Our tax principles make it very clear that all tax planning for our clients must support genuine commercial activity. While our clients are ultimately responsible for any decisions in relation to their tax affairs, we, like other banks, do provide some tax related products to our clients. These products are well-understood by tax authorities and often deliver tax incentives specifically intended by governments. Conversely, for example, we would not provide non-standard loan funding to a client, where the funding is integral to the client\u2019s tax planning, if the tax planning does not comply with the spirit, as well as the letter, of the law. Our business Tax influences decisions about how we run and organise our business and about where we base our operations. Making these decisions is an integral part of running a global commercial organisation. When tax is a factor in deciding where or how we do business, the decisions we make are consistent with our tax principles and profits are taxed in the locations in which the economic activity generating them takes place. Accordingly, transactions that artificially transfer profits into a low tax jurisdiction would not be consistent with this approach or our tax principles. A key part of ensuring we pay taxes in the countries where economic value is created is how we price transactions between our group companies, more commonly known as \u2018transfer pricing\u2019. When we invest in our business, we may benefit from tax incentives as intended by national governments, some of which are discussed further on page 11. Overview 10 Tax contribution Barclays PLC home.barclays/annualreport Approach to tax Our approach to transfer pricing in more detail: The prices applied to our intra-group transactions are representative of the prices that would be paid in respect of transactions between independent parties (also known as \u2018arm\u2019s-length pricing\u2019). The \u2018arm\u2019s-length prices\u2019 that we apply are derived from established and widely accepted international standards such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Transfer Pricing Guidelines, which are applied on a globally consistent basis across all countries in which we operate. We seek to comply with all global and local documentation requirements to support the arm\u2019s length prices applied to our intra-group transactions including, for instance, undertaking external economic benchmarking studies of comparable transactions between third parties. Tax authorities may sometimes take a differing view of what an arm\u2019s-length price should be for a transaction. This can lead to the same income being taxed in two countries (often referred to as \u2018double taxation\u2019). National governments often seek to reduce double taxation by entering into double taxation treaties between one another. These treaties include mechanisms for tax authorities to agree an arm\u2019s-length price for a transaction between one another and the taxpayer. These mechanisms can include \u2018Mutual Agreement Procedures\u2019 (MAP) which allow tax authorities in two countries to agree on a mutually acceptable arm\u2019s-length price where the taxpayer has been unable to reach an agreement with the tax authorities directly. Treaties may also include a mechanism for tax authorities to agree an arm\u2019s-length price on an upfront basis with a taxpayer through \u2018Advance Pricing Agreements\u2019 (APA). Where we are or may be subject to double taxation, we do seek to reach agreement on an appropriate arm\u2019s-length price through one of the generally available mechanisms outlined above. Country by country data Low tax territories We have business operations in a number of jurisdictions which have low tax rates, principally in the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey, where for many years we have been a significant local employer. However, we do not market the tax benefits of these locations to our clients. Where a client chooses to invest via these locations, Barclays will only provide the client with services that are compliant with our tax principles. We have also historically incorporated companies under the laws of other low tax jurisdictions, particularly the Cayman Islands, because the local company law makes it simple and cost effective to set up and manage companies. All of the profits generated in these companies are subject to corporation tax at a rate at least equal to the UK corporation tax rate. \u201c We apply arm\u2019s-length pricing to our intra-group transactions in accordance with established and widely-accepted international standards.

            "text": "Our investment and tax incentives Approach to tax We invest in a number of areas that attract tax incentives as intended by national governments. National governments often encourage businesses to invest and undertake certain activities that support wider policy objectives such as stimulating economic growth, driving technological innovation and accelerating the transition to a low-carbon economy. One way governments do this is by offering tax incentives to encourage businesses to help achieve these policy objectives. We invest in a number of areas that attract tax incentives and here we highlight some examples. 11 Overview Tax contribution Approach to tax Barclays PLC home.barclays/annualreport Research and development expenditure credit (RDEC) Innovation is at the heart of what we do and how we think at Barclays. We are a bank of \u2018firsts\u2019 and have been pioneering new technologies in the market for many years, such as the launch of the UK\u2019s first credit card and the world\u2019s first ATM. As digital banking, international transactions and transaction security become increasingly central to all our lives, we are investing more than ever in building the Barclays of the future. We spend significant amounts on research & development (R&D) each year to research, design and develop innovative technological solutions that protect our millions of customers and lead the world in digital banking. Given the economic and scientific importance of R&D, the UK Government has been providing specific R&D tax incentives such as RDEC to encourage and support R&D activities since 2000. Where the R&D activities undertaken by Barclays meet the specific requirements of the UK\u2019s R&D tax regime, we are able to benefit from the R&D incentives. Capital allowances As a UK headquartered banking group, we invest significant sums in our UK real estate and infrastructure footprint, most notably our London head office, campuses in Radbroke and Northampton as well as our retail branch network. In 2021, we officially opened a new \u2018state of the art\u2019 campus in Glasgow. The Glasgow campus alongside other new campus developments in Whippany, New Jersey, and Pune, India, are part of our global strategy to create world-class facilities. Our investment in the Glasgow campus is expected to have around 5,000 employees by 2023. Our investment to construct and fit out the new campus with energy-saving plant, machinery and equipment will attract capital allowances, which provide UK tax relief on some types of capital expenditure. Similarly, when we refurbish our existing high street branches throughout the UK, some of that investment may benefit from capital allowances. The UK\u2019s capital allowances system was first introduced in 1946 and is a mainstay of the UK tax system, and has been developed over time by successive governments to encourage businesses to make capital investments in the UK. Country by country data Renewable energy tax credits Many national governments are seeking to move towards a low-carbon economy by encouraging businesses to invest in the renewable energy infrastructure that is essential to driving the transition throughout the wider economy. Given the scale and urgency of the challenge, investment from private enterprise has a crucial role to play. The US Government provides tax incentives in the form of \u2018Investment Tax Credits\u2019 for investing in qualifying renewable energy projects including solar, geothermal and fuel cell energy. We support the renewable energy and clean technology sector, helping the transition to a low carbon economy. More information on how we are supporting the transition to a low-carbon economy can be found at home.barclays/annualreport Barclays PLC Country Snapshot 2021"

            "text": "Approach to tax We understand the importance of having strong governance and risk management in place in relation to our tax affairs. Our governance and risk management Third line of defence Internal Audit function Overview Barclays has been defined by the Financial Stability Board, in conjunction with other regulatory bodies, as a Globally Systemically Important Bank and this means that our Group-wide risk and governance procedures are subject to continuous review and scrutiny. Our procedures are also regularly reviewed and revised in light of factors such as material changes to our business. At Barclays, risks are identified and managed through our Enterprise Risk Management Framework (ERMF), which supports the business in its aim to embed effective risk management and a strong risk management culture. The ERMF governs the way in which Barclays identifies and manages its risks. Under the ERMF, we operate a three lines of defence model for managing risk as follows: First line of defence Revenue generating and client facing areas, along with associated support functions Second line of defence Risk and Compliance functions 12 Tax contribution Tax risk is no exception and is managed in accordance with the three lines of defence model. We consider there to be three different categories of tax risk as set out below: \u25a0 Technical tax risk: Tax law is a continually evolving area. It is possible that tax authorities may take a differing view or dispute our interpretation of tax law in a way that affects the tax treatment of a specific product or transaction filed in a tax return. It is also possible that the interpretation of tax law or generally accepted custom or practice may change over time. \u25a0 Operational tax risk: The risk of unexpected financial cost, for example, additional tax payments, interest or penalties, arising from inadequate or failed processes or systems or human errors resulting in the filing of incorrect tax returns, the late filing of tax returns or the late payment of taxes. \u25a0 Stakeholder perception risk: The risk that an action or decision we take will reduce the trust in our integrity and competence by tax authorities, our regulators, investors or the public, leading to potential financial loss and reputational damage. Barclays PLC home.barclays/annualreport Approach to tax In the management of tax risk at Barclays, the Barclays tax department is part of the first line of defence. Our tax department identifies and manages tax risk by developing appropriate policies, standards and controls to apply across our organisation. The second line of defence is carried out by our Risk and Compliance functions whose role is to perform independent review and challenge of the risk management activities of the first line of defence, including the Barclays tax department. The third line of defence is the Barclays Internal Audit function which provides independent assurance to the Board and executive management over the effectiveness of governance, risk management and control including our management of tax risk. We have formal procedures around the governance of tax matters and tax risk that must be adhered to by all employees, and we are subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act control requirements in relation to financial statements disclosures including those related to tax. Our Board oversees tax matters and tax risk and carries this out through our Board Audit Committee. The Board Audit Committee reviewed and approved our UK Tax Strategy which can be found on page 16.

Our commitment to information sharing We cooperate with tax authorities globally to reduce the scope for individuals and companies to evade tax. We do this by fulfilling all of our information sharing obligations under the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). CRS requires information relating to customers to be collated and provided to tax authorities who share this information with one another. FATCA is an international standard for the automatic exchange of information relating to US persons. We support the aims of CRS and FATCA and have met all of our 2021 information reporting obligations. Making Tax Digital (MTD) is a key part of the UK government\u2019s plans to become one of the most digitally advanced tax administrations in the world, making it easier for individuals and businesses to comply with their tax obligations and pay the right amount of tax. We are contributing to making MTD a success as we provide a large amount of information to HMRC such as interest earned by our customers on savings accounts as well as details of remuneration paid as an employer. Furthermore, we have put strong governance procedures in place across our business to enable us to fulfil our disclosure obligations under the EU Directive on Administrative Cooperation (commonly known as DAC 6) and the OECD\u2019s Mandatory Disclosure Rules. These rules help to combat harmful tax practices by requiring the disclosure to tax authorities of cross- border arrangements which feature certain \u2018hallmarks\u2019. 14 Overview Tax contribution Approach to tax Our support for a fair tax system Protecting the integrity of tax regimes and improving tax systems continues to be a priority of governments globally as they seek to repair public finances in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. We recognise the challenges of the \u2018Digital Economy\u2019 and support the OECD\u2019s new two-pillar solution to address the tax challenges arising from the digitalisation of the economy as part of its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) initiative. Pillar One is focused primarily on changing the way digital businesses are taxed. Pillar One will reallocate a portion of international businesses\u2019 profits to the territories in which their customers are based for taxation purposes. As a regulated financial services business, we expect to be excluded and should not be impacted by Pillar One. Regulated financial services businesses already report, and are taxed on, the profits where their operations are carried out and their customers are based. We support the aims of the Pillar Two Global Anti-Base Erosion (GloBE) rules which will impose a Global Minimum Tax. This will be set at a rate of 15% and is expected to apply to all large multinational businesses from 2023. We welcome the progress that these measures represent in advancing the development of a fair and transparent global tax system.

Our role in global efforts to combat tax evasion We have well-established mechanisms for raising concerns about unethical or unlawful behaviour through our \u2018Whistleblowing\u2019 policy, which applies equally to tax matters. 15 Overview Tax evasion is the deliberate and illegal non-payment, or underpayment, of any tax and often involves concealing income or assets from tax authorities. Tax evasion is a crime in the UK and in other countries where we operate. Barclays is committed to only dealing with customer or client assets that have been appropriately declared to the relevant tax authority. Barclays plays a full role in global efforts to combat tax evasion and has worked alongside governments and international organisations, such as the OECD, to support their efforts to combat tax evasion. In the UK, Barclays is an active member of the Joint Money Laundering Intelligence Taskforce (JMLIT), a public-private partnership between law enforcement agencies and the financial sector to share and analyse real time intelligence about money laundering (including tax evasion) risks. Tax contribution Barclays is subject to the provisions of the UK Criminal Finances Act 2017 which introduced a corporate criminal offence of failing to prevent the criminal facilitation of tax evasion in relation to UK and foreign taxes. We do not engage in tax evasion and do not provide products or services with the aim of facilitating tax evasion by others. We also take a zero tolerance approach to any person acting for us or on our behalf who helps customers evade tax in any country.

This strategy has been approved by Barclays PLC\u2019s Board Audit Committee. Overview Tax contribution 16 Approach to tax Barclays PLC home.barclays/annualreport Country by country data We have summarised the way we manage our UK tax affairs below As outlined earlier in this report, we operate in accordance with our tax code of conduct in relation to all of our tax affairs, including our UK tax affairs. Transparent and professional dealings with HMRC Governance and controls over UK taxes Responsible approach to tax planning Effective risk management \u25a0 In the UK, this involves maintaining a professional and constructive relationship with HMRC. We have regular meetings with HMRC to discuss their enquiries and material issues in relation to our tax affairs. This helps focus both our and HMRC\u2019s resources on the most important issues. \u25a0 As a large group, we make hundreds of filings to HMRC every year, and aim to make all of these on time. We also aim to make these tax filings as clear as possible and include explanations as required to ensure that our returns are easy to understand. \u25a0 Where we face significant uncertainty in relation to the application of tax law, we may seek to agree with HMRC how the tax law should apply. Any agreements have not provided any advantage to us as they have not resulted in any tax treatment that would not be available to other taxpayers. \u25a0 In the rare instances that we ultimately need to have recourse to the Courts to resolve tax issues, we continue to interact with HMRC in a constructive and helpful manner. \u25a0 Our global governance procedures are discussed more fully on page 12. The same procedures apply to our UK tax affairs. \u25a0 We are fully committed to the UK Code of Practice on Taxation for Banks and are fully transparent with HMRC about our governance procedures and how they comply with the Code\u2019s requirements. \u25a0 Under the Senior Accounting Officer regime in the UK, we provide attestations annually to HMRC confirming that we have appropriate accounting arrangements to allow our tax liabilities to be calculated correctly. \u25a0 We seek to ensure that our tax filings in the UK reflect full compliance with transfer pricing requirements and the arm\u2019s-length principle. \u25a0 All our tax planning is undertaken in accordance with our tax principles, tax code of conduct and the UK Code of Practice on Taxation for Banks. Both our tax principles and tax code of conduct are set out in full on page 9. \u25a0 Any tax planning we undertake is subject to rigorous review through internal governance processes before being undertaken. \u25a0 Where necessary, we consult with external advisers to help us manage our tax position and to ensure that we are making appropriate decisions. \u25a0 Given the scale of our business, the broad range of our tax obligations and the complexity of the tax laws that we are required to comply with, uncertainty arises in relation to our tax liabilities from time to time. We refer to this uncertainty as tax risk and it is discussed in detail on page 12. \u25a0 Where there is significant uncertainty or complexity in relation to a tax risk, we may seek advice from external experts. This gives us confidence that our tax returns are appropriate. \u25a0 We proactively seek to identify, evaluate, manage and monitor UK tax risks to ensure our financial exposure is well understood and is within a level that we consider acceptable. \u25a0 Our reputation is very important to us and we take our external stakeholders\u2019 expectations into account when we make decisions in relation to our tax affairs.

In particular, we considered sensitivities over the level of available financial resources indicated by the Group\u2019s financial forecasts in taking account of the impact of severe but plausible scenarios on these and assessing whether these downside scenarios applied take into account all reasonably possible outcomes.

Our conclusions based on this work: \u25a0 we consider that the directors\u2019 use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the CBCR Information is appropriate; and \u25a0 we have not identified, and concur with the directors\u2019 assessment that there is not, a material uncertainty related to events or conditions that, individually or collectively, may cast significant doubt on the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern for the going concern period. However, as we cannot predict all future events or conditions and as subsequent events may result in outcomes that are inconsistent with judgements that were reasonable at the time they were made, the above conclusions are not a guarantee that the Group will continue in operation.

In this risk assessment we considered the following: \u25a0 Our meetings throughout the year with the Group Head of Risk, Group Head of Compliance and Group Head of Legal and reviews of Barclays\u2019 internal ethics and compliance reporting summaries, including those concerning investigations. \u25a0 Enquiries of management, internal audit, and the Board Audit Committee, including obtaining and reviewing supporting documentation, concerning the Group\u2019s policies and procedures relating to: \u2013 detecting and responding to the risks of fraud and whether they have knowledge of any actual, suspected or alleged fraud; and \u2013 the internal controls established to mitigate risks related to fraud, including the appropriateness and impact of changes made to these controls to facilitate remote/hybrid working. \u25a0 The Group\u2019s remuneration policies, key drivers for remuneration and bonus levels. \u25a0 Discussions among the engagement team regarding how and where fraud might occur in the financial statements and any potential indicators of fraud. The engagement team includes audit partners and staff who have extensive experience of working with banks, and this experience was relevant to the discussion about where fraud risks may arise. The discussions also involved our own forensic specialists to assist us in identifying fraud risks based on discussions of the circumstances of the Group, including consideration of fraudulent schemes that had arisen in similar sectors and industries. The forensic specialists participated in the initial fraud risk assessment discussions and were consulted throughout the audit where further guidance was deemed necessary. Barclays PLC 19 home.barclays/annualreport Tax contribution We communicated identified fraud risks throughout the audit team and remained alert to any indications of fraud throughout the audit. This included communication from the Group audit team to component audit teams of relevant fraud risks identified at the Group level. We have identified five fraud risks which were communicated to component audit teams. The nature of these fraud risks is substantially unchanged from the prior year but the allocation of certain fraud risks to components has been updated. The fraud risks we identified are set out below: \u25a0 IFRS 9 ECL: Judgmental qualitative adjustments made to the ECL provision; \u25a0 Valuations: Risk relating to unobservable pricing inputs used to price level 3 fair value instruments; \u25a0 Revenue recognition: Cut-off of the recognition of revenue from investment banking advisory fees; \u25a0 Existence and accuracy of unconfirmed over-the- counter bilateral derivatives; and \u25a0 The risk of management override of controls, common with all audits under ISAs (UK).

Over the last decade, we have been consistently ranked as one of the top five largest taxpayers in the UK, in terms of taxes paid. Our principal UK activities include consumer banking and payments operations, as well as a full service, global corporate and investment bank. Various factors mean that the profit we report as being earned in the UK differs from the profits on which we are subject to UK corporation tax. In particular, being a UK-headquartered bank, the profit figure includes dividends received from overseas subsidiaries, which are not taxed in the UK as they have already been taxed in the jurisdiction in which those profits were earned. A large part of our accounting profits reported as earned in the UK in 2021, were made up of dividends received from our overseas subsidiaries, which are not taxable under UK law. In addition, the tax treatment and accounting treatment of various expenses differ, for example Additional Tier 1 coupons and cash contributions to our main UK pension fund. In 2021 we paid corporation tax of \u00a356m. The amount of corporation tax we paid was reduced by the utilisation of available brought forward tax losses to offset against current year taxable profits. The US is our main market outside the UK. Our principal US activities include a significant and wide ranging corporate and investment banking business and international consumer cards operations. We are subject to US taxes, including federal, state and local corporate income taxes on profits from those activities. We have for a number of years been utilising tax losses incurred which have now been exhausted in full and therefore substantial cash tax payments were made during the year. Our operations in Luxembourg include treasury activities such as raising financing, collateral management and funding our Barclays International operations, as well as investment banking activities including our equities business. We have also continued to develop our corporate banking business in Luxembourg, which offers our European clients a range of banking products and services, including cash management, debt, foreign exchange and trade finance facilities. While these activities are taxed locally at a rate above the UK corporation tax rate, we paid no corporation tax in Luxembourg in 2021 as our taxable profits were offset by substantial tax losses brought forward from prior years, and also due to dividend income not being taxable under Luxembourg law. We have unused tax losses which are automatically carried forward, and available to offset against future taxable profits. Our global service centre, which provides world class technology and operations solutions and services to our businesses globally, is located in India. We also carry on corporate and investment banking activities and provide private banking services in India. These activities are taxed locally at rates above the UK corporation tax rate.

In these cases, it is possible that tax is paid in a different country to the one where profits, upon which the tax is paid, are reported. Commentary: We have explained the nature of our activities in each country. That disclosure is included within the commentary column in the table above together with our explanation of any matters of interest. 25 Barclays PLC home.barclays/annualreport Barclays PLC Country Snapshot 2021 Tax contribution Turnover: Turnover gives an indication of the size of our business in each country, and we have ordered the table in descending order. Turnover includes net interest income, net fee and commission income, net trading income, net investment income, net premiums from insurance contracts and net claims and benefits incurred on insurance contracts. Some of the turnover numbers need to be treated with care as technical accounting requirements applicable to the way these figures are prepared mean there is an element of double counting. Profits generated in the US and then paid to the UK as a dividend for example, will be included within both the US and UK figures. Adjustments to address this double counting, called intra-group eliminations, are broken down by type (dividends, recharges, hedging and other) at the end of the table and total \u00a35,683m for 2021 in relation to turnover. Additionally, and again to avoid double counting, turnover numbers in each country exclude dividends received which are sourced from profits generated in the same country. Profit/(loss) before tax: These numbers are accounting profits. As with the turnover figures, these numbers include some double counting which is reconciled at the bottom of the table. Total intra-group eliminations for the profit/(loss) before tax column are \u00a32,840m. In addition, to avoid double counting, profits attributable to dividends received which are sourced from profits generated in the same country are also excluded. Total tax paid: This column shows the total tax Barclays actually paid in each country in 2021. The following columns break this total down into its constituent parts. Most of the taxes paid in any given year will not relate directly to the profits earned in that year. For example, bank levy is a tax on how we fund ourselves and is paid regardless of whether or not we make any profit. Approach to tax Corporation tax paid: This column records corporation tax actually paid in each country in 2021. Corporation tax payable in any given year is not directly comparable to profits for the same 12-month period. This is because tax on profits is paid across multiple years. In addition, taxable profits are calculated as prescribed by tax law which usually results in differences between accounting and taxable profits. This means it is possible that relatively high corporation tax can be paid when accounting profits are low and vice-versa. The amount of tax paid shown in the financial statements also includes withholding taxes. Withholding taxes comprise the tax charged on dividends or other income received, which is typically paid at the point of distribution from one country to another. We have kept these amounts separate from corporation tax paid by country in the table above. Employer payroll taxes paid: These are taxes borne by us, based on government social security policies in each country and, for example, in the UK represent employer\u2019s national insurance contributions. They do not represent income tax on payments to our employees or employees\u2019 national insurance contributions which are taxes collected but not borne by us. VAT paid: This includes VAT and other consumption taxes (including goods and services tax, consumption tax and US sales and use taxes). The amounts relate to irrecoverable VAT paid. Unlike many other businesses, financial services businesses are only able to reclaim a small proportion of the VAT they incur, making VAT a significant part of our tax contribution. Not all countries have a VAT system which is why there are no entries against some countries within the table. These numbers do not include any VAT charged to customers on Barclays\u2019 products and services which we collect on behalf of tax authorities. Country by country data Bank levy paid: Bank levy is a tax paid based on the value of certain liabilities on our balance sheet. As with corporation tax, bank levy is paid across multiple years and therefore the tax paid of \u00a3241m in 2021 should not be expected to equate to the accounting accrual in 2021. Other: Other taxes are the material property taxes that Barclays paid in 2021 and include, for example, taxes on the property we use in our business such as our network of high street branches. Public subsidies received: Includes only direct support from governments such as government grants. Average number of employees: The number of employees has been calculated as the average number of employees, on a monthly full-time equivalent basis, who were permanently employed by Barclays PLC or one of its subsidiaries during the relevant period. An average of the number of full-time equivalent employees at the end of each calendar month has been calculated. Contractors, agency staff, and staff on extended leave, such as maternity leave, are excluded. Intra-group eliminations: These include adjustments that relate principally to transactions between Barclays businesses in different countries which are included within the individual country turnover, but are then eliminated in determining the overall Barclays Group results to avoid double counting. Intra-group eliminations include dividend payments, income from intra-group transfers of assets, and income arising from hedging transactions that occur at a consolidated Barclays Group level rather than an individual entity level.

Here we look at some of the other ways in which we contribute including our efforts to support our customers and clients, and our communities through the COVID-19 pandemic. Economy We continue to be a major investor, employer and purchaser of goods and services. In addition, we generate economic activity by supporting individuals and businesses from small and medium-sized enterprises to larger corporates.

Since April 2020, we have matched \u00a38.1m raised and donated by colleagues for COVID-19 relief efforts - which has meant a total of more than \u00a316.2m for 2,000 charities around the world. Through our LifeSkills programme, we have a target to help a further 10 million people to develop the skills and confidence they need to succeed, as well as place 250,000 people into work by the end of 2022. Against this target, the programme has upskilled 9.8 million people and placed 193,400 into work. Since LifeSkills first began in 2013, it has reached 15.3 million people.

Irrecoverable VAT We pay VAT when we buy goods and services from our suppliers. Unlike most other businesses, banks can only claim back a proportion of the VAT that they incur, making this a significant cost to our business.
